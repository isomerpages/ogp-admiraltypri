<h2>2026</h2>
<p><strong>Important: Updates on Personal iPad Usage (Primary 5 and Primary 6)</strong>
<br>Dear Parents and Guardians,
<br>Please be informed of a change regarding the use of personal devices in
Admiralty Primary School. With effect from <strong>Monday, 5 January 2026,</strong> all
Primary 5 and Primary 6 students are <strong><u>not required to bring their personal iPads to school </u></strong>until
further notice.
<br>Teachers will adjust lesson plans accordingly. Should any digital resources
be required for specific classroom activities, the school will provide
the necessary school-owned devices for student use.
<br>This shift in the approach on personal iPad usage is to allow the school
to conduct a review of our digital learning routines and ensure that students
are focusing on core foundational skills and pen-and-paper practice as
they prepare for the academic year ahead.
<br>We seek your cooperation in ensuring that your child leaves their device
at home starting from the first Monday of the school year. We will provide
further updates via the Parents Gateway should there be any changes to
this arrangement.
<br>Thank you for your continued partnership and support.</p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br>Chan Siew Li (Mdm)
<br>ICT HOD</p>

<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that everyone has had a good start to Term 3 so far.
Term 3 promises to be an exciting and meaningful one, as our Admirals participate
in a range of enriching experiences – from learning journeys across various
levels to the National Education (NE) Show for our Primary 5 students.
This year’s National Day also marks Singapore’s 60 years of independence,
and our Admirals will get to learn more about the significance of this
milestone and soak in the spirit of our celebrations. As our Admirals grow
and develop from such experiences (from both Admiralty Primary School and
beyond), I often wonder: what are the desirable traits of an Admiral?</p>
<p>This reminds me of a heartwarming encounter that I would like to share
with everyone. I was returning to Singapore from a family trip last week.
I was seated next to this young, well-spoken gentleman on the flight home.
We shared with each other a little about our experiences on our respective
trips. What began as a brief and simple conversation soon took an interesting
turn. When the plane landed in Singapore, we happened to ask each other
about our passions and professions. When I mentioned to him that I am working
in Admiralty Primary School, this gentleman broke into a wide smile and
said, “I studied in Admiralty Primary School and graduated in 2010!” For
me, it was a very pleasant and serendipitous encounter. Not only did I
get to connect with an alumnus of Admiralty Primary School, it also made
me so proud to know that he remembers his time with Admiralty Primary School
so fondly. Subsequently, he shared his contact details with me and even
offered to return to Admiralty Primary School to share career insights
and engage in conversations with our students. The confidence, connectedness,
passion and empathy that this alumnus displayed were priceless character
traits that we would value and hope for in every Admiral. His unreserved
willingness to contribute back to his alma mater also touched me and encouraged
my heart: his parents, school and teachers have all played a part in influencing
him to become who he is today.</p>
<p>As we strengthen our home-school partnership in nurturing the right values
in our children and develop them holistically, I encourage all of us to
help our Admirals see that they are part of something bigger than themselves.
Using our school setting as an example, when students have this selfless
spirit of contributing, not only will they help to create a better environment
for others, they are indirectly creating a better school culture for themselves.
It is this very reason that my colleagues and I have been placing great
emphasis on the importance of being kind towards others. And as the significant
adults in their lives, we must model the way! Just last term, our “Be Admirably
Kind” movement showed us how kind our Admirals can be; we “caught” many
doing kind acts towards their friends and teachers. Kindness begets kindness,
and those who benefited from these acts of kindness also helped to pass
on this spirit of giving towards others.</p>
<p>Our school’s vision is to develop every student into inspiring and empathetic
leaders with a strong global outlook; our mission is to nurture compassionate
citizens and lifelong learners. Admiralty Primary School will be celebrating
our 30th anniversary in 2027 and as we look forward to this milestone,
let us continue working hand in hand to chart the way forward for our Admirals
and school. Thank you and wishing everyone an enjoyable Term 3.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Mr Chen Zhongyi</p>
<p>Principal</p>

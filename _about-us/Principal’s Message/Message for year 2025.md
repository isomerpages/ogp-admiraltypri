<p>A warm welcome to our Primary One Admirals, and here’s wishing everyone
a very blessed and fulfilling 2025 in advance! We are only a day away from
2025, and the new year promises to be a year of growth and learning for
all of us.</p>
<p>At Admiralty Primary School (ADPS), we endeavour to develop all our Admirals
into <strong><em>inspiring and empathetic leaders with a strong global outlook</em></strong>.
This School Vision is bold, yet undoubtedly achievable. To achieve this,
we will need the strong partnership and support from all stakeholders of
Admiralty Primary School, especially parents/guardians given our close
working relationship.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Power of a Supportive Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Since joining the school in October 2022, I have witnessed for myself
how our strong partnerships grow the size of the educational “pie” for
our young Admirals.&nbsp; Alone, we know that we have our limits and constraints
– our resources are finite and there’s only just so much that we can do
for our students separately on the school and home fronts.&nbsp; But the
moment we join hands and put our hearts and heads together to develop our
Admirals, our students’ growth is accelerated.&nbsp; The whole is certainly <strong><em>more than</em></strong> the
sum of its parts, as the saying goes. &nbsp;In 2024, the intentional and
meaningful involvement of many parents and PSG members encouraged me and
further strengthens the point that I have made. I am grateful towards parents
for coming in to volunteer their time, effort and thoughts. All your contributions
and efforts have benefited our Admirals in one way or another, be it through
programmes such as Math@Lunch, our reading support programme, or feedback
that you have provided us so that we can constantly improve our school’s
practices and processes. This is made possible when we partner each other
in a thoughtful manner. Thank you for doing so!</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, work together to <strong>create a supportive community for our Admirals</strong>.
It is my goal to lead my team in building a community – comprising our
parents, community partners, alumni, School Advisory Committee – that would
allow Admiralty Primary School to grow and flourish in the days ahead.
A supportive community would provide all our people with learning and growth
opportunities. We can complement each other’s efforts, reinforce our beliefs
and expand our options for our young Admirals.&nbsp; A supportive community
is like a tightly-knit family – one where its members care for each other
and place strong emphasis on helping the others do well.&nbsp; Such is
the power of a supportive community, and I envisage our Admirals benefitting
from it. &nbsp;Our Admirals are very much part of this community too! We
would hence like to grow them into empathetic and inspiring students who
care for <strong>others</strong> and are <strong>not self-centred</strong>.</p>
<p>The Home-School partnership remains the most critical and fundamental
part of this supportive community.&nbsp; I look forward towards working
with all parents in building a constructive relationship that is founded
on mutual respect.&nbsp; My staff and I will work closely with you in the
days ahead. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you need any clarification.&nbsp;
Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Mr Chen Zhongyi</p>
<p>Principal</p>

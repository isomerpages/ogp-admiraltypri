<p>15 September 2025</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Three terms have passed, and we are starting the last term of 2025 in
a few days’ time. Not only do our Admirals deserve credit for developing
the resilience, flexibility and adaptability to manage school life over
the past three terms, I would also like to strongly affirm parents and
guardians for your tenacity and strong support for your child’s educational
journey! And as we just celebrated Teachers’ Day last week, I would like
to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for their dedication
and commitment towards the education of every Admiral.</p>
<p>At the opening of the 15th Parliament on 5 September, President Tharman
encouraged all Singaporeans to foster a “we first” society at every level,
and to “put the collective before the self”. This echoes Prime Minister
Lawrence Wong’s message during the National Day Rally in August, where
he urged us to embrace a “we first” attitude. At Admiralty Primary School,
we believe strongly in laying the foundation and platforms for our students
to grow such a mentality. In fact, the “T” in our School Values (G.R.I.T.)
stands for <strong>Teamwork </strong>– a reminder that we achieve more when
we work together and uplift those around us. Through platforms such as
Admiralty’s Got Talent, National Day Observance Ceremony and Kalaithiran
(just to name a few school events that concluded in Term 3), our Admirals
have shown – and impressed us – time and again that they are capable of
achieving great things through solid teamwork and a “we first” mentality.</p>
<p>To further encourage the “we first” mindset, both in school and at home,
I would like to propose a small but powerful shift in how we guide our
children. When our Admirals ask what others (be it teachers, parents or
peers) can do for them, we can gently reframe their thinking and prompt
them to consider instead: What can I do to help solve this problem or support
someone else? You can imagine how this could possibly work at home too!
If your child places their cup/plates in the sink, expecting parents or
helpers to wash up after them, we could suggest to our Admirals to play
a small part and contribute towards solving the problem. Through small
yet consistent actions, our Admirals will be able to see how their contributions
play an important part towards creating a better environment for everyone
over time. The following are some questions we could get our Admirals to
reflect on in the days ahead:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Why is it important to adopt a “we first” attitude, and not “me first”?
What happens if everyone adopts a “me first” mentality?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does a “we first” attitude mean to me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some things that I could do – in school and at home – to contribute
towards the positive well-being of others? (Small actions and steps count
and are important!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Parents and guardians, thank you once again for your steadfast support.
As we step into Term 4, let us continue this strong Home-School partnership
and work together to ensure a positive and meaningful conclusion to the
school year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p><strong>Mr Chen Zhongyi </strong>
<br><strong>Principal</strong>

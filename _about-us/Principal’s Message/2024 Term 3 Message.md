</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>A very warm welcome back to a brand-new term and semester! This promises
to be an exciting new chapter of learning and discovery, and I hope that
our Admirals are looking forward to learning and growing in the days ahead.
As adults and role models in their lives, let’s grow alongside our Admirals,
and continue to show them how learning for life is joyous, energising and
uplifting.</p>
<p>In my Term 2 letter to parents, I wrote about the importance of nurturing
our children’s capacity, ability and willingness to learn.&nbsp; I also
mentioned how this is far more important than solely the pursuit of academic
grades and results for results sake. I also shared with everyone that MOE
has identified 3 emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (E21CC) that
will be critical for our students to master, for them to thrive in a world
that is moving ahead and changing so rapidly. It is my firm believe that
for our students to become wholesome individuals who are able to do well
in the future, these E21CC are no longer “good to have” – they are essential
and fundamental skills that all our Admirals <strong><u>must</u></strong> possess
and strengthen over time. &nbsp;To reiterate, these are the E21CC that
I have been emphasising:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical, Adaptive and Inventive
Thinking;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication, Collaboration and
Information Skills; and</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural
Literacy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like to use this letter to share my thinking on the second point
of “Communication, Collaboration and Information (CCI) Skills”. As a school,
we have been providing several platforms for our students to communicate
their ideas, both written and verbal. We can certainly do more to <strong><u>build the confidence</u></strong> of
our students to speak up and express their ideas in an eloquent and coherent
manner.&nbsp; We will leverage platforms both in class and beyond the classroom
to further hone our Admirals’ communication skills. A fundamental building
block of communication is also how deeply and widely our Admirals read.
Through reading, our students can pick up new insights and knowledge to
nourish their minds and challenge their thinking. As such, it is my wish
that parents/guardians could continue to partner us strongly in our focus
of getting our Admirals to read – both English Language and Mother Tongue
Language medium books – widely and voraciously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is, however, insufficient for our Admirals to be developing their skills
and competencies in an individualistic manner. The importance of teamwork
and collaboration is well-documented, and our students need to know how
to collaborate and partner one another in their pursuit of knowledge and
excellence. The ability to collaborate also hinges upon the idea of treating
one another with respect and dignity; the school setting is a microcosm
of the real world, and we are exposing our students to the opportunity
to learn and play alongside their friends with respect and kindness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, “Information skills” refer to the ability to source for, select
and connect the dots between digital and non-digital information with discernment.
With tools like internet – and now, Artificial Intelligence – at our fingertips,
our Admirals are confronted with a deluge of information. Being able to
select and utilise the right types of information, and being <strong><u>discerning</u></strong> and <strong><u>ethical</u></strong> in
the process of doing so, is a skill that needs to be developed over time.
We should certainly help to facilitate how our students learn these skills
in school and at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to inform all parents that
the school will be making an adjustment to the end time of our school day
on Mondays <strong><u>next year</u></strong>. Starting from January 2025,
school will <strong><u>end at 2.10 p.m. on all days</u></strong> for all
levels.&nbsp; (At present, our Admirals finish school at 2.40 p.m. on Mondays,
and 2.10 p.m. from Tuesdays to Fridays.)&nbsp; For this to happen, we will
need to make slight adjustments to our timetable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the start time for our P3-P6s on Mondays will not change, CCA will
end at 9.10 a.m. instead of 9.40 a.m. P3-P6s will subsequently have their
Healthy Snack Break (HSB), before the first lesson starts at 9.30 a.m.&nbsp;
The P1-P2s of 2025 would hence be required to report to school latest by
9.30 a.m. on Mondays. Reporting and dismissal timings for Tuesdays to Fridays
remain unchanged from our current arrangement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The table below shows the reporting and dismissal timings for the different
levels for 2024 vis-a-vis 2025, and we hope that this comparison would
make for ease of reference and understanding.</p>

<p>By making such an adjustment, we have effectively aligned dismissal timing
for every day of the school week. In our conversations and dipstick surveys
with different parents, we have gotten feedback that this alignment of
dismissal timing makes good sense, and many feel that an earlier dismissal
would also allow our Admirals to have a better/earlier rest as the dismissal
timing of 2.40 p.m. is relatively late, especially when compared to the
other Primary Schools. Nevertheless, we would like to acknowledge that
with any adjustments in timings, there might be some of our parents/guardians
who are not positively impacted.&nbsp; As such, we hope that by communicating
this adjustment to parents and guardians about 6 months in advance, we
can work with you to effect the change smoothly.&nbsp; We have been/will
be communicating these changes with our school-based Student Care Centre
(SCC) – Learning Harbour – as well as the Kids Excel vendor. Please be
assured that we will work closely with you and the different partners to
transit to this new dismissal timing on Monday (as well as the new reporting
timing for P1-P2s) smoothly. Should you foresee any challenges, pls do
not hesitate to get in touch with us so that we can work something out
together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you once again for partnering us in the educational journey of our
Admirals. If you have any concerns of questions, please do not hesitate
to get in touch with your child’s teachers or the school. Take care and
here’s wishing everyone a very fruitful Term 3!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Mr Chen Zhongyi</p>
<p>Principal</p>

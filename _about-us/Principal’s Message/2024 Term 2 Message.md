<p>18 March 2024</p>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>A big and warm welcome back to an exciting new term of 2024! I hope everyone
has had a chance to recharge yourselves during the March break and spend
much needed quality time with your loved ones. The process of relationship
building is critical towards developing our Admirals (and ourselves!) into
joyful, all-rounded individuals; let’s continue to work hard at strengthening
our relationships and partnerships over the term and year.</p>
<p>For my Term 2 letter to everyone, I would like to focus on the importance
of two things – “the value of (true) learning” and “21st Century Competencies”.
Over the whole of Term 1 and for the rest of the year, my colleagues will
be sharing key values to the whole school after flag raising in the morning.
They will be touching on topics that connect with them, ranging from developing
empathy and compassion, to having a zest for learning. While these brief
sharing sessions in the mornings are not part of our Admirals’ formal timetable/subjects,
the nuggets of wisdom from my colleagues have been invaluable. I would
like to call them “life lessons”, because the teachings, sharing and opportunity
for reflection are so rich. I hope your children have been bringing some
of these messages back and sharing their reflections with you! If not,
it is certainly not too late to start, and by bringing this to your awareness,
I would like to encourage you to check in with your child on his/her understanding
of what has been said. Most importantly, do ask them to reflect on these
values and think about<strong> how they can apply them in their daily lives.</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of a “life lesson” that was delivered by Mdm
Normala on 8 March, the last day of Term 1 – her sharing on this day has
inspired my thoughts for this letter. Mdm Normala shared some good ideas
on what we could do during the March Term break, which includes reading,
creating an art piece and learning something new. She had also left three
questions for all Admirals to reflect on, and I would like to seek the
assistance of all parents to set time aside this week to have a good reflection
with your child:</p>
<p>1. In what areas have I excelled?</p>
<p>2. What challenges have I faced, and how could I have approached them
differently?</p>
<p>3. How can I improve my learning strategies and habits for better performance
and personal growth?</p>
<p>Mdm Normala also ended off with a very powerful quote from an author,
Brian Herbert, on this idea of “learning”:</p>
<p><em>“The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice."</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parents/guardians, at Admiralty Primary School, we strongly believe that
developing our Admirals’ <strong>capacity</strong>, <strong>ability</strong> and <strong>willingness</strong> to
learn is far more important than just achieving the academic grades and
results themselves. If our Admirals are too fixated on the end result but
not the journey of learning and growth, any result will only be temporary;
their growth will be stagnated, and learning becomes a chore for them.
Let us all (school leaders, staff of Admiralty Primary School and parents)
be the role models and fuel to ignite our Admirals’ joy and passion for
learning! I am confident that we can do this together.</p>
<p>How might we be able to do so? Growing our Admirals’ joy and passion for
learning is a long process. Indeed, some will say that it is a lifelong
journey in and of itself. The Ministry of Education’s Framework for 21st
Century Competencies and Student Outcomes (see attached link) offers good
insights on this: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies</a>
</p>
<p>MOE has identified 3 emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) that can
enable our students to thrive in school, beyond school, and a future world
that is rapidly changing. These E21CC are:</p>
<p>1. Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking;</p>
<p>2. Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills; and</p>
<p>3. Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy.</p>
<p>Let’s take the skill of “Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT)”
as an example. Our world is becoming increasingly digitalised and inter-connected;
events that are happening in other parts of the world are having deep implications
on our country. There is a common saying that we are inculcating in our
students, <strong>today</strong>, the knowledge, skills and dispositions
to solve problems of the <strong>future</strong>. The future is very unpredictable
and complex; there are no textbook answers for solving problems of tomorrow.
It is hence crucial that we grow our Admirals’ ability to think critically,
adapt to different situations, take in multiple perspectives to build on
their own ideas, and be driven towards creating/inventing new solutions
and ideas. As such, one should also expect that the way our teachers teach
must be different from how we were taught in the past. We cannot rely on
textbook answers, primarily drill-and-practice methods, and “spoon-feeding”
our Admirals with all the seemingly correct solutions. Instead, our teachers
are constantly improving their craft to ask our students open-ended questions,
provide perspectives but challenge students to debate them respectfully
and think on their feet; sometimes, Admirals will ask questions that educators
ourselves are not able to answer, and I think that is wonderful! We can
then encourage our Admirals to do a bit more research into their query,
be discerning about their information sources, and share their findings
with their teachers and friends.</p>
<p>The close partnership and collaboration between our school and home can
yield desired outcomes for our Admirals. When you have an opportunity today
or this week, do pose the reflection questions above to your child, and
spend some quality time discussing your responses. Being introspective
and reflective is a good way to get our Admirals to learn and internalise
what they have learned so far. I hope you will have a fruitful and happy
discussion!</p>
<p>I am deeply appreciative of our partnership and collaboration. As always,
please do not hesitate to get in touch with your child’s teachers or the
school if you have questions or concerns. Wishing everyone a wonderful
Term 2 of learning and growth!</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p></p>

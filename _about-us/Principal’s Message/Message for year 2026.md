<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Welcome back to a new year, and to our P1 Admirals and parents/guardians:
a warm welcome to Admiralty Primary School!</p>
<p>At Admiralty Primary School, we strive to nurture our Admirals into <strong><em>Inspiring and Empathetic Leaders with a Strong Global Outlook</em></strong>.
This bold vision stems from a strong belief that (1) our Admirals themselves
have what it takes to grow up well and become active contributors to our
society and nation, (2) our partnership with like-minded parents like yourself
provides a conducive and safe space for our children to develop holistically,
and (3) the staff of Admiralty Primary School will constantly place our
children at the heart of what we do so that we nurture them into compassionate
citizens and lifelong learners (our school’s mission).</p>
<p>We have heard the proverb: “It takes a village to raise a child”. Having
led this school as School Principal since end-2022, this proverb resonates
so deeply with me. It takes so many of us – parents, staff of Admiralty
Primary School, the community etc. – to raise an all-rounded Admiral, and
when he/she grows up well to become a contributing citizen of good character,
it warms our hearts. But if I may also point out something in this proverb
that is not often talked about – the “village” consists of all the other
children too! And it is in this “village” that our Admirals learn that
they grow alongside one another; their actions and deeds have a profound
impact on one another. This is why a <strong><em>“We First”</em></strong> mentality
must be adopted at Admiralty Primary School. Whatever we do, we ought to
ask ourselves: “how would my actions or words affect my friends/classmates/schoolmates?”,
or “what can I do to help others?” I would like to encourage parents to
partner us in using these as possible conversation starters and questions
to engage your child in the course of the year.</p>
<p>A “We First” mentality also encourages our Admirals to be kind in their
words, actions and deeds because they are constantly looking out for others.
Started since 2025, our school’s “Be Admirably Kind” movement has encouraged
many of our Admirals to treat others around them with kindness and respect.
Our Admirals have been taught that kindness does not take place only when
we perform big acts. Often, the smallest actions and deeds are those that
matter the most. For example, holding the door for the person behind you,
smiling at your friend and greeting him/her with a warm “good morning!”,
helping the teachers carry books when you see her with her hands full etc.
This reminds me of a quote on kindness by Scott Adams that is one of my
personal favourites:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Remember there’s no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple effect with no logical end.” </em></strong>
</p>
<p>As adults, let us be our Admirals’ role models in displaying a “We First”
attitude and kindness towards everyone around us. Together, I look forward
to partnering you in creating a safe and enabling environment for our Admirals
to thrive in. Thank you and have a wonderful 2026.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
<br>Mr Chen Zhongyi
<br>Principal</p>

Established in 1997, Admiralty Primary School is commemorating 25 years on the 27th of May 2022.

As we commemorate 25 years in the community, we would like to share with you some of the new updates and activities that will lead up to the actual day of commemoration.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>The LKY wall is a selection of motivational quotes that serves to honour Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee Kuan Yew devoted his entire life to Singapore, rallying Singaporeans to build a nation and a home that we can all be proud of. We can pay no greater tribute to him than to uphold the principles upon which he built this country. In remembering the past, we must also look to the future. We hope to inspire all our students and staff to be leaders in their own strides and empathetic members of our society.</p>

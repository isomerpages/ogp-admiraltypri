#### School Crest

     style="width:35%">

The school crest was designed through the collaborative effort of the teachers. We strive to help all our pupils acquire the thirst for knowledge with humanity; thus the motto, Knowledge with Humanity.

The symbols of an open book, a hand and five bands in a circular badge with the colours, blue, yellow and red form the emblem. The colours, blue, yellow and red stand for humanity, excellence and equal opportunity respectively.

The open book represents the knowledge acquired by a pupil through the two stages of Primary Education (Foundation and Orientation). The hand symbolizes guidance and humanity.

The five bands signify the five shared values that form the foundation of our nation. The letter ‘A’ formed by these symbols is derived from the school’s name. The circle, which endorses these symbols signifies the rounded education that the school provides.

<b><u>Song Lyrics:</b></u> <br>
**Verse 1:** <br>
With an all-round education
<br>
We shall keep on moving
<br>
Striving for excellence in everything we do
<br>
Using knowledge as our strength with humanity
<br>
To care and share, a helping hand
<br>
For those who are in need

**Chorus:**
<br>
We are proud of Admiralty Primary
<br>
Where the best in education can be found
<br>
We’re the best and always looking far beyond
<br>
We’ll stand proud and tall
<br>
We’ll stand proud and tall for our dear school

**Verse 2:**
<br>
Here we learn to be achievers for society
<br>
We’re prepared to do our best
<br>
For our school and country
<br>
There’ll be problems we may face, but we’ll persevere
<br>
To plan our lives the best we can
<br>
For a brighter future
<br>

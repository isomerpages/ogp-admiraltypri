# School Crest and Song
***School Crest***

The school crest was designed through the collaborative effort of the teachers. We strive to help all our pupils acquire the thirst for knowledge with humanity; thus the motto, Knowledge with Humanity.

The symbols of an open book, a hand and five bands in a circular badge with the colours, blue, yellow and red form the emblem. The colours, blue, yellow and red stand for humanity, excellence and equal opportunity respectively.

The open book represents the knowledge acquired by a pupil through the two stages of Primary Education (Foundation and Orientation). The hand symbolizes guidance and humanity.

The five bands signify the five shared values that form the foundation of our nation. The letter ‘A’ formed by these symbols is derived from the school’s name. The circle, which endorses these symbols signifies the rounded education that the school provides.

Admiralty Primary School Song

Verse 1:

With an all-round education

We shall keep on moving

Striving for excellence in everything we do

Using knowledge as our strength with humanity

To care and share, a helping hand

For those who are in need

Chorus:

We are proud of Admiralty Primary

Where the best in education can be found

We’re the best and always looking far beyond

We’ll stand proud and tall

We’ll stand proud and tall for our dear school

Verse 2:

Here we learn to be achievers for society

We’re prepared to do our best

For our school and country

There’ll be problems we may face, but we’ll persevere

To plan our lives the best we can

For a brighter future

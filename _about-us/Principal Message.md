# Principal Message
***Words from the Principal***

Admiralty Primary School started in 1997 with 45 classes. Through the last twenty years, our staff in Admiralty Primary has established a strong culture of care and created a sense of belonging among staff and pupils.

All of us at Admiralty Primary pledge to provide our children with a quality education that develops their potential to the fullest. Our staff sees in each child not as who they are but as who they can become. We want our children to learn to learn and to learn the core skills that will enable them to succeed in the unpredictable future. We want them to do well beyond the national examinations and to develop good values and habits that will put them in good stead well beyond their schooling days. With a strong and committed staff, we aim to lay these strong foundations in our children.

We have built a strong tradition with our loyal staff and alumni. Many of our teachers continue to teach in Admiralty Primary even after they have moved further away from the Woodlands area. Three of our young teachers are previously students of Admiralty Primary and we welcome them to foster a strong school spirit amongst our young children.

Many of our students from our early batches are young parents now and we are beginning to see many of them sending their children back to Admiralty Primary to be immersed in the same tradition that have shaped themselves into who they are today.

Our staff works hard and is committed to providing a good learning environment for our children. Even so, the role and responsibility to educate our children fall on each and every one of us, including our parents and community. There are many things to do and many more things still remain to be done as we forge ahead in nurturing future generations of Singaporeans. The school, parents and the community will accomplish as a team much more than what the school might accomplish alone.

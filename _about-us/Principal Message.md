Admiralty Primary School commemorated our 25th Anniversary in 2022. Established in 1997 with 45 classes, Admiralty Primary School’s educational journey through the years has seen a growth from strength to strength. We remain steadfast in our mission to nurture all our students into compassionate citizens and life-long learners. <img src="/images/20221213_105903.jpg"

As the fifth Principal of Admiralty Primary School, I would like to express my deepest appreciation towards the four Principals before me – Mr Freddie Kee, Mdm Lim Soh Lian, Mr Albert Alcantara and Mr Pek Wee Haur. Under their leadership and stewardship, this school has grown into the Admiralty Primary school that we know today – a school that focuses on the holistic development of every child, dedicated staff who selflessly care for and nurture our children, and a caring and enabling school environment that allows our students to flourish and develop their abilities in the moral, social, intellectual, physical and aesthetic domains. I am also well aware that this journey is an ongoing one that we will continue to walk with the support of our SAC, parents, alumni and community partners. My team and I are committed towards growing every child to his/her fullest potential. 


##### Growing Together: Gratitude, Courage, Excellence

Aspirational, yet very much achievable, this theme highlights our school’s strengths and dispositions that we want to deepen further. Gratitude is an important life quality of being thankful, and we are firm believers of that at Admiralty Primary School. By showing an appreciation for what we have, instead of focusing on what we do not, we allow ourselves to adopt a positive mindset that yearns for learning, growing, and becoming a better version of ourselves. I would also like to encourage all of us to have the courage and tenacity to welcome the future with optimism, regardless of the changes it may bring. By being courageous, we are more likely to see possibilities and be excited by challenges, instead of feeling daunted and tentative. Lastly, our pursuit of excellence should never cease. We firmly believe that every child wants to learn and have unique inclinations and strengths. In our pursuit of excellence, we shall patiently work with our children to grow their abilities holistically, and not rest on our laurels or develop the feeling that “we have reached our destination”. This pursuit of excellence is also inextricably linked to the spirit of innovation. By innovating for a better future, we are bound to meet challenges and fail at times, but we know how to pick ourselves up and continue moving forward.  

It was also with great intentionality that my staff and I included the word “Together” in our 2023 School Theme. It serves as a reminder to every one of us that our individual growth has an impact on the growth of the school, and vice-versa. Together, we can always achieve more; there is scope for all of us to work on being more “others-centred”. As a good practice, we should ask ourselves every day: How can I be of help to someone else today? 

It is my sincere wish that our SAC, parents, alumni and community partners will join us on this journey of growing together with gratitude, courage and excellence, as we grow our children to their fullest potential through strong partnerships. You have all played a part in helping us build the Admiralty Primary School of today, and we look forward to a fruitful 2023 together. 

Lastly and very importantly, I cannot stress enough that my positive outlook for Admiralty Primary School in 2023 and beyond stems from the quality and dedication of some very key people of this school – my staff and Vice-Principals. They all want to do their best for our children, and I am fortunate to be working alongside them in this exciting journey. 

Thank you, and here’s wishing everyone a happy and fulfilling 2023. 

Mr Chen Zhongyi
Principal

<h4>International Exchange Programme</h4>
<p>At Admiralty Primary School, our International Exchange Programme broadens
our students’ horizons and nurtures them to become confident, culturally
aware, and globally minded citizens.</p>
<p>The programme has two key components: hosting and the Overseas Learning
Journey (OLJ).</p>
<p>From Primary 1 to 4, pupils learn about various cultures through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Classroom lessons and art explorations,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visits to local cultural sites,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversational language modules to experience the language of other cultures,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting overseas pupils in the classroom to learn about their lives and
cultures firsthand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences prepare our students for the Overseas Learning Journey
(OLJ) in Primary 5, where every pupil is offered the opportunity to participate.
First implemented in 2011, the OLJ offers our students an authentic, immersive
experience in a new culture, helping them develop self-confidence and independence
away from home.</p>
<p>Through the OLJ, our students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Appreciate different perspectives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop cultural understanding,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster independence and resilience, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interact meaningfully with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences broaden our students’ worldview while strengthening
their sense of identity and belonging as Singaporeans. They learn to navigate
cultural differences with respect and empathy while carrying with them
the values of care, respect, and openness wherever they go.</p>
<p>At Admiralty Primary School, we believe these experiences are essential
in preparing our students to thrive in a globalised world while remaining
rooted in Singapore’s values.</p>

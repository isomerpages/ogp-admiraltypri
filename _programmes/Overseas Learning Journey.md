#### Overseas Learning Journey

From Primary 1 to 4, pupils learn about the various cultures through classroom lessons, exploration in art and their visits to various local cultural sites.

They also participate in learning the language of another cultures through conversational language modules, as well as hosting overseas pupils in the classroom. This culminates in an Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) to experience the cultures of neighbouring countries.

First implemented in 2011, the OLJs offer an authentic immersive experience in a new culture for our pupils to develop self-confidence and independence away from home. Every pupil is offered the opportunity to participate in an OLJ at Primary 5.

They get first-hand experience of daily school life in another country. The interactions with people from diverse backgrounds shape their awareness and understanding of cross-cultural differences.

Across the years, Admiralty Primary School has established a network of connections with different schools around the world and exchanged opportunities for our pupils to embark on.

### Reporting and Dismissal Time 
  
Please note that parents/guardians will not be allowed to park in the school carpark. You are encouraged to park at the nearby HDB carparks next to the school.

For the first day of school on **Tuesday, 2 January 2024, your child/ward will report to school by 8.00 a.m.**

Parents will be allowed to drop off your child/ward at the bus bay. You will have to leave the school after dropping off your child/ward.

**Your child/ward will be dismissed at 12.00 p.m. on the first day of school via Gate C only.**

### Lunch Time 

Students will be allowed to purchase food from the canteen and we encourage parents/guardians to give pocket money of about $2.00 - $2.50 to your child/ward if he/she is intending to purchase his/her own food during lunch.

Due to the limited space in the canteen area and to ensure the well-being of our students, parents/guardians will not be allowed to view your child/ward during lunch. This is to acclimatize your child/ward to their new school and routines. Please be rest assured that our team of teachers will be stationed at the canteen to assist your child/ward to buy his/her food.

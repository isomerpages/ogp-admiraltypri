<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We have arranged for Care Corner to give a Parents’
Talk on that day. You are invited to join us for the talk at the Multi-Purpose
Hall.</p>
<p><u>Synopsis of the Parent’s Talk</u>
</p>
<p>This talk will provide parents with an understanding of how the brain
influences emotional regulation and relationships. The session will equip
parents with strategies to help children regulate emotions, make thoughtful
choices, and build essential social-emotional skills, while strengthening
the parent–child relationship.</p>

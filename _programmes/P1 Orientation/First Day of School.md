### What to bring (Coming Soon)


Content

### Reporting and Dismissal Time 
  
Please note that parents/guardians will not be allowed to park your vehicles in school carpark and are encouraged to park at the nearby HDB carparks next to the school.

  

**Reporting to school** –For the first day of school, please ensure that our children report to school by 8.00 a.m. Parents will be allowed to drop off your child at the bus bay. However, you will have to leave the school thereafter.

  

**Dismissal** – Dismissal will be at Gate C only.  

Our children will be dismissed at 2.00 p.m. on the first day of school.

  

### Canteen & Recess for Students


  

Students will also be allowed to purchase food from the canteen and we encourage parents/guardians to give pocket money of about $2.00 - $2.50 to your child/ward if he/she is intending to purchase his/her own food during recess.  

  

Due to the limited space in the canteen area and to ensure the well-being of students who are not wearing masks when eating, parents/guardians will not be allowed to view their child/ward during their recess. This is to acclimatize your child to their new school and routines. Please rest assured that our team of teachers will be stationed at the canteen to assist your child/ward to buy his/her food.

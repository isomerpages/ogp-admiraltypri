### Drop Off and Dismissal
  
##### Drop Off
Parents/Guardians who walk their child/ward to school can accompany them up to the Gate A (beside security post) and Gate C respectively.

* All drop-off vehicles are only allowed into the school compound until 7.30 a.m.
* No right turn is allowed from 7.00 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. at the Vehicle Exit Gate to avoid traffic congestion along Woodlands Circle.

Children who arrive after 10.00 a.m. on Mondays and 7.30 a.m. from Tuesdays to Fridays are considered late and their punctuality will be reflected in their End-of-Year Report.

##### Dismissal&nbsp;
Dismissal will be at 2.40 p.m. on Mondays and 2.10 p.m. from Tuesdays to Fridays at Gate C.

**Please indicate on the clip nametag the mode of dismissal for your child**&nbsp;(Gate C, School Bus or Name of Student Care).&nbsp;  

#### Absence from School
Parents/Guardians should ensure regular attendance of your child/ward in school.&nbsp;
* The school takes a serious view of prolonged absenteeism or irregular attendance, especially without proper authorisation. Children who are absent from school must submit a Medical Certificate or Letter of Excuse upon their return to school.
* We would greatly appreciate if you inform one of the Form Teachers before 8.00 a.m. the reason of your child’s/ward’s absence.
* Parents/Guardians who wish to bring their child/ward overseas on family holidays / to attend to personal matters are to do so during the school vacations.

### Birthday Celebrations
We understand that many of our children look forward to birthday celebrations. However, in view of possible food allergies, we would like to inform that parents/guardians are not allowed to organise birthday celebrations for your child/ward in the school. This includes the distribution of goody bags. It is a concern that students may start to compare the extent in which these celebrations are carried out, adding unnecessary stress to parents.

We can still celebrate birthdays meaningfully by singing a birthday song and giving well wishes to the birthday boy or girl. This will bring about stronger teacher-student-student relationship which will create a positive schooling experience for your child/ward.

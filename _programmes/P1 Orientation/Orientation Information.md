### Drop Off and Dismissal
  
##### Drop Off
Parents/Guardians who walk their child/ward to school can accompany them up to the Gate A (beside security post) and Gate C respectively.

* All drop-off vehicles are only allowed into the school compound until 7.30 a.m.
* No right turn is allowed from 7.00 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. at the Vehicle Exit Gate to avoid traffic congestion along Woodlands Circle.

Children who arrive after 10.00 a.m. on Mondays and 7.30 a.m. from Tuesdays to Fridays are considered late and their punctuality will be reflected in their End-of-Year Report.

##### Dismissal 
Dismissal will be at 2.40 p.m. on Mondays and 2.10 p.m. from Tuesdays to Fridays at Gate C.

**Please indicate on the clip nametag the mode of dismissal for your child** (Gate C, School Bus or Name of Student Care).   

#### Absence from School



  

### Birthday Celebrations
  
We understand that many of our children look forward to birthday celebration. However, in view of possible food allergies, we would like to inform that parents are not allowed to organize birthday celebrations for your child within the school, including the distribution of goody bags, as these gatherings usually involve food items.

  

It is a concern that students may start to compare the extent in which these celebrations are carried out, adding unnecessary stress to parents.

  

We can still celebrate birthdays meaningfully by singing birthday song and giving well wishes to the birthday boy or girl. This will bring about stronger teacher-student-student relationship which will create a positive schooling experience for your child.

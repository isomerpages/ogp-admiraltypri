<h3>Welcome Message from Principal</h3>
<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>On behalf of all staff and students of Admiralty Primary School, I would
like to extend a warm welcome to you and your child/ward to this big family!&nbsp;This
promises to be an exciting and rewarding new chapter for the lives of all
our children.</p>
<p>They will need our time, encouragement, and continuous support as they
grow and develop. For our young ones, it will be the beginning of an exciting
journey for them as they learn and develop into responsible citizens and
passionate learners in our school. For us as adults, we will experience
positive changes in our lives as well: we will learn how to journey alongside
our young Admirals, and constantly improve our ways of growing them into
confident and resilient individuals with a collective sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Please look through the information on this page, as it will assist you
in your child’s transition into this new environment. We look forward to
working together as a team to nurture and guide our children, ensuring
that they reach their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s education. We look forward
to forging a strong school-home partnership with all parents and guardians
for the development of every Admiral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhongyi</p>
<p>Principal</p>

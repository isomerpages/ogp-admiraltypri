### Welcome Message from Our Principal

Dear Parents and Guardians,  

I extend a warm welcome to you and your child/ward at Admiralty Primary School.&nbsp;Our children are about to embark on a new chapter in their lives. They will need your time, encouragement, and continuous support as they grow and develop. It will be the beginning of an exciting journey for them to learn and develop into responsible citizens and passionate learners in our school. We kindly ask you to look through the information on this page, as it will assist you in aiding your child’s transition into this new environment.
We look forward to working together as a team to nurture and guide our children, ensuring they reach their fullest potential.

Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s education.



Yours Sincerely, <br>
Mr. Chen Zhongyi <br>
Principal

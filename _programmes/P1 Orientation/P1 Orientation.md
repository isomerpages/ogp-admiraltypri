### Welcome Message from Our Principal

Dear Parents and Guardians,  

I would like to warmly welcome you and your child/ward to Admiralty Primary School.&nbsp;

Our children will be embarking on a new phase in their life. They will need your time, encouragement, and continuous support in their growth and development. It will be the beginning of an exciting journey for them to learn and develop into good citizens and passionate learners in our school.

Please go through the information in this page as we support you in helping your child adjust to the new environment.&nbsp;

We look forward to work together as a team to nurture and coach our children to maximize their potential.

Thank you

Yours Sincerely, <br>
Mr. Chen Zhongyi <br>
Principal

<h4>HSB</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are encouraged to bring their HSB from home as they will not
be going to the canteen at that time. Examples of HSB are nuts, fruits,
sandwiches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lunch</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will be allowed to purchase food from the canteen and we encourage
parents/guardians to give pocket money of about $2.00 - $2.50 to your child/ward
if he/she is intending to purchase his/her own food during lunch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Absence from School</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Parents/Guardians should ensure regular attendance of your child/ward
in school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school takes a serious view of prolonged absenteeism or irregular
attendance, especially without proper authorisation. Children who are absent
from school must submit a Medical Certificate or Letter of Excuse upon
their return to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would greatly appreciate if you inform one of the Form Teachers before
8.00 a.m. the reason of your child’s/ward’s absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Parents/Guardians who wish to bring their child/ward overseas on family holidays / to attend to personal matters are to do so during the school vacations.</u>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Birthday Celebrations</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We understand that many of our children look forward to birthday celebrations.
However, in view of possible food allergies, we would like to inform that
parents/guardians are not allowed to organise birthday celebrations for
your child/ward in the school. This includes the distribution of goody
bags. It is a concern that students may start to compare the extent in
which these celebrations are carried out, adding unnecessary stress to
parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can still celebrate birthdays meaningfully by singing a birthday song
and giving well wishes to the birthday boy or girl. This will bring about
stronger teacher-student-student relationship which will create a positive
schooling experience for your child/ward.</p>
</li>
</ul>

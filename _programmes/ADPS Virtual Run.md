##### Welcome to ADPS Virtual Run!

Virtual running is like any other type of running but the difference is that you can run at any location, at any pace and at any time.
We are calling all our Primary 1 to 6 students, ADPS alumni and staff to join us in this virtual run.

##### FAQ

<b>Q1. Can my parents register for the run?</b>

We encourage all parents to run with their children and make it a family activity that will not only improve physical and mental health but also a chance for family bonding. However, only ADPS students and alumni can officially register for the run and receive their finisher tees upon completion.

<b>Q2. Can I walk instead of run?</b>

We encourage all participants to run/jog/walk at their own pace and readiness level.

<b>Q3. How can I check my total distance covered and timing?</b>

[Please click our google site](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/adps-virtual-run-2023/home) to check the scoreboard. It will be updated with the top 20 runners per level as well as school wide every Tuesday. We do encourage you to keep track of your own progress so that you are on tasked to complete your 21.1km or 42.2km.

<b>Q4. Why are my runs not being recorded or reflected in the scoreboard?</b>

Your submission may be incomplete or more clarifications needed to verify your run. We examine every submission carefully to ensure that students uphold <b>INTEGRITY</b> in their submissions. If we find that your timing is inconsistent and dubious, we will not update the scoreboard.

<b>Q5. What running apps can I use?</b>

Runkeeper, Nike Run Club, Strava, Adidas Running, Pacer, Map My Run etc. You can even use a simple stopwatch if you do not have any running apps.

<b>Q6. Do I have to take a picture of my tracking device and upload it when I submit my run results?</b>

Good news! This year, we will not be asking for your running timing evidence!

We would like everyone to uphold our school value <b>INTEGRITY</b> in their submissions. However, there will be self-declaration during every run submission and do take note that we examine every submission carefully and if we find that your timing is inconsistent and dubious, we will be contacting you for further clarifications. Let's hope we do not have to do that!

# ADPS Virtual Run
Welcome to ADPS Virtual Run! 

Virtual running is like any other type of running but the difference is that you can run at any location, at any pace and at any time. 
We are calling all our Primary 1 to 6 students, ADPS alumni and staff to join us in this virtual run. 
All registration must be done once before starting on the run. We encourage participants to commit to the distance and complete their runs.

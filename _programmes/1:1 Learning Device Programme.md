#### Overview

The 1:1 programme at Admiralty Primary is a move towards individualising learning, which can increase independence and self-directed learning in students, and extend their learning beyond the classroom.

Students who have their own learning devices have been found to take greater pride and ownership over the knowledge they create, with a flow-on to more flexible forms of schooling.

The 1:1 programme can extend formal learning communities to include parents, siblings and other people important in students' lives. Also, we are looking into how this programme may lead to initiating global communication and collaboration and develop creative expression.

In 2013, the school piloted one class with iPads and in 2014 until current, the programme has been extended to students who have opted in the classes using the learning device.

Moving forward, the school will be giving an option for parents to choose between iPad and Chrome Tab in 2021.

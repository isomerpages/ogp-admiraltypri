# DSA / ECG

# Direct School Admission (DSA)

DSA for ALL

All secondary schools are offering DSA and hence, we want DSA to be accessible to each and every student and that they are not fixated only on academic but also to develop their interests and talents.

We want ADP students to be able to make better strategic choices to enter the secondary school of their choice - be it via academic merit or Direct School Admission (DSA).

# Education & Career Guidance (ECG)

This is the online platform for us to have conversations with the students – as a level, class or even individuals. We also push out reminders on e-open house, scheduled secondary schools talks and DSA information and info-guides here.

# ECG Portfolio

Student’s thinking are made visible via their ECG Portfolio. The clearer they are of their goals, the more willing they are to work hard. With feedback, they will continue to refine and sharpen their choices.

# FAQ

1. What is DSA-Sec?
   DSA-Sec aims to promote holistic education and provides Primary 6 students an opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school based on a diverse range of talents and achievements that may not be demonstrated at the PSLE. Each secondary school offers distinctive programmes and sets its own selection process and criteria to admit students with talents that can be further developed by these programmes.

2. Should my child apply for DSA-Sec?
   Your child should consider applying for DSA to enter a school of their choice to continue to develop their interests and talents. If successful in his/her application, he/she will not participate in the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting. As he/she has committed to the school, he/she will also not be able to seek a transfer to another school after the release of PSLE results.

3. Which school should my child apply to?
   Finding a good fit will help your child enjoy learning at an appropriate pace and enable him/her to benefit from the school’s overall programmes. Details are available at the secondary schools’ websites.

4. How can my child apply for DSA-Sec?
   Apply online via the DSA-Sec Portal from 5th May to 1st June (do await for Press Release). Either parent may log in using Singpass to submit application. You can indicate up to 3 choices. For each choice, you will need to choose a school and a talent area. Of the 3 choices, a maximum of 2 choices can be used to apply to the same school (under 2 different talent areas).
   Note: For SOTA and Singapore Sports School, you need to apply directly to the school based on their application timeline.

5. Do I need to submit any hardcopy documents during application?
   There is no need to submit any testimonials or documents via the DSA-Sec Portal. All information needed will be shared by us via school cockpit. You may indicate in the optional field any non-school based activities and achievements related to your child’s talent which your child may have participated outside school.

6. Can my child with Wushu CCA, apply for DSA for volleyball?
   Yes. Your child needs to see the transference of skills and values learned in Wushu that will put him/her in a good position to be successful in his/her application for Volleyball DSA.

7. When will I be informed of the outcome of my child’s application?
   Application outcome will be released by mid-September. If your child has at least 1 Confirmed Offer (CO) or a Wait List (WL) offer, you will receive email notification in end October to submit up to 3 school choices, in order of preference.
   Note: If your child has accepted an offer from Singapore Sport School (SSP), you should NOT participate in S1 Posting. SSP will contact you separately.

8. Which stream will my child be studying if he/she is successful in his/her DSA application?
   To gain admission via DSA, your child still needs to attain a PSLE score that qualify them for a course (Express, Normal Academic or Normal Technical offered by the school.

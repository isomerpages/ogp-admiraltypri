<h3>Direct School Admission (DSA)</h3>
<p>DSA for ALL</p>
<p>All secondary schools are offering DSA and hence, we want DSA to be accessible
to each and every student and that they are not fixated only on academic
but also to develop their interests and talents.</p>
<p>We want ADP students to be able to make better strategic choices to enter
the secondary school of their choice - be it via academic merit or Direct
School Admission (DSA).</p>
<h3>Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG)</h3>
<p>This is the online platform for us to have conversations with the students
– as a level, class or even individuals. We also push out reminders on
e-open house, scheduled secondary schools talks and DSA information and
info-guides here.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is DSA-Sec? DSA-Sec aims to promote holistic education and provides
Primary 6 students an opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school
based on a diverse range of talents and achievements that may not be demonstrated
at the PSLE. Each secondary school offers distinctive programmes and sets
its own selection process and criteria to admit students with talents that
can be further developed by these programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should my child apply for DSA-Sec? Your child should consider applying
for DSA to enter a school of their choice to continue to develop their
interests and talents. If successful in his/her application, he/she will
not participate in the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting. As he/she has committed
to the school, he/she will also not be able to seek a transfer to another
school after the release of PSLE results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which school should my child apply to? Finding a good fit will help your
child enjoy learning at an appropriate pace and enable him/her to benefit
from the school’s overall programmes. Details are available at the secondary
schools’ websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can my child apply for DSA-Sec? Apply online via the DSA-Sec Portal
from 5th May to 1st June (do await for Press Release). Either parent may
log in using Singpass to submit application. You can indicate up to 3 choices.
For each choice, you will need to choose a school and a talent area. Of
the 3 choices, a maximum of 2 choices can be used to apply to the same
school (under 2 different talent areas). Note: For SOTA and Singapore Sports
School, you need to apply directly to the school based on their application
timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I need to submit any hardcopy documents during application? There is
no need to submit any testimonials or documents via the DSA-Sec Portal.
All information needed will be shared by us via school cockpit. You may
indicate in the optional field any non-school based activities and achievements
related to your child’s talent which your child may have participated outside
school.</p>
</li>
<li>

needs to see the transference of skills and values learned in Wushu that

notification in end October to submit up to 3 school choices, in order
of preference. Note: If your child has accepted an offer from Singapore

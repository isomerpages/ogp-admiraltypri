# DSA / ECG
# Direct School Admission (DSA)

DSA for ALL

All secondary schools are offering DSA and hence, we want DSA to be accessible to each and every student and that they are not fixated only on academic but also to develop their interests and talents. 

We want ADP students to be able to make better strategic choices to enter the secondary school of their choice - be it via academic merit or Direct School Admission (DSA).

# Education & Career Guidance (ECG)
This is the online platform for us to have conversations with the students â€“ as a level, class or even individuals. We also push out reminders on e-open house, scheduled secondary schools talks and DSA information and info-guides here.

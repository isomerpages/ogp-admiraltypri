# School Bag Policy
Your ***SMART*** bag to a healthy back. 

| Self – discipline              | : | Only take what you need, plan and pack ahead for the next school day.                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Must carry right               | : | Carry your bag using both straps of the haversack bag over both the shoulders. Onestrap bag or carrying on just ones shoulder can put unnecessary weight on your spine.                       |
| Avoid heavy material           | : | Choose light weight materials for pencil case, bag, lunch box and water bottle to lighten your load. Do not use trolley bags as they are heavy and not user-friendly when you use the stairs. |
| Rest                           | : | Give your shoulders a rest whenever possible e.g. while waiting at the bus stops and assembly area.                                                                                           |
| Take good care of your posture | : | Bad posture can lead to pains in the back and shoulders. Care for your posture and stay healthy.                                                                                              |

<p>The school DOES NOT allow students to use *unauthorized electronic devices
in school.<em>&nbsp;</em>
<br><em>*Mobile phones, smartwatches, headphones, earbuds etc., that are capable of capturing, storing, displaying and/or transmitting visual, audio or verbal information</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Reasons for Not Allowing</strong>
<br>Examination guidelines state that students are not to be found in possession
of unauthorized electronic devices during examinations.
<br>Mobile phone and smart watch with calling and messaging functions are
disruptive to teaching and learning in the classroom, as students can be
distracted by calls, messages, or using the social media, multimedia and
internet functions of these devices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Communicating with Your Child During School Hours</strong>
<br>If you need to contact your child during school hours, you could call
the General Office at Tel: 63620598. In urgent situations, students are
also allowed to make telephone calls from the General Office.</p>
<p><strong>3. Monitoring Your Child’s After School Hours</strong>
<br>Many parents have indicated that they wish to monitor their child’s after-school
activities through mobile phones. All after-school programmes will be made
known in advance via consent forms, and any subsequent changes will be
communicated through letters or phone calls. It is also important to inculcate
a sense of responsibility in our students and to nurture the habit of informing
their parents of their activities and whereabouts.</p>
<p>To ensure a safe and focused learning environment, the following guidelines
apply:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mobile phone / Smart watch with calling and messaging functions must be
switched off until the end of school hours, inclusive of any official /
school-based programmes / activities / events such as Remedial / Enrichment
lessons, CCAs, and Higher Mother Tongue lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After school, with a teacher’s or Staff Member’s permission, your child
may switch on their devices (on silent mode only) to contact their parents
and at designated call / messaging zones:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>a. School bus bay</p>
<p>b. Gate A dismissal area</p>
<p>c. Gate C dismissal area</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The use of unauthorized electronic devices is not permitted in any other
areas of the school, even after school hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Confiscation and Collection</strong>
<br>If your child is found using an unauthorized electronic device, in breach
of the guidelines, the Form Teacher or Staff Member would first confiscate
the device, then notify you and make the necessary arrangements for you
to collect the device personally.</p>
<p><strong>5. Unauthorized electronic devices lost in school</strong>
<br>If your child brings and loses the device in school, he/she is advised
to report the incident immediately to any teacher or Staff Member. The
school reserves the right not to conduct a search for the lost device as
this results in a loss of valuable curriculum time. However, the Form Teacher
or Staff Member would inform you of the incident.</p>

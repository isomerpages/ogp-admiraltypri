# Assessment Matters

- Pupils are to be responsible to bring the necessary stationery and instruments (e.g. calculators and Mathematical set) for the exams.
- There will not be any make-up for the P3 to P6 End-of-Year Examinations (except for the EL and MTL Oral components).
- Any child who is absent for the exams/exercises will need to produce a medical certificate from a medical doctor. Handwritten letters are not accepted. Marks will be computed accordingly, taking into account the absence with a valid reason.
- P1 and P2 pupils who are absent from scheduled exercises will be allowed to take the paper so that feedback can be given to parents. However, marks received from the exercises will not be included in the final weighting for the year.
- Absence without valid reasons
      Pupils who are absent without valid reason:
      -   will not be awarded any marks for the paper which he/she had missed.
<br><b>Examples of absence without valid reason:</b> <br>
      -   Accompanying parents overseas during term time.<br>
      -   Scheduling external examinations such as piano exams/ballet exams during exam period.

* Students are required to be punctual for all weighted assessments and examinations. Students who are late with no valid reason would be allowed to sit for the remaining duration of the papers with no additional time provided.
* No extra time will be given to pupils who are not able to complete their paper within the stipulated time. Answers on the answer script/s (e.g., OAS) will be taken as final.
* The school views cheating as a serious offence. Pupils caught cheating or with an intent to cheat will be awarded a zero mark for the component/paper. Disciplinary action will also be taken against the pupil.

<h4>Assessment Matters</h4>
<p>To ensure a fair and consistent approach, Admiralty Primary has established
the following assessment &amp; examination policy:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Absence from Weighted Assessments/Examinations:</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are absent for weighted assessments or examinations are required
to provide an up-to-date medical certificate as proof of their absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases of a family bereavement, documentation confirming the unfortunate
event should be provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absences due to representing the school in competitions or official school
events will be considered a valid reason with prior official school approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will not accept a letter of explanation from parents as sufficient
justification for missing assessments or exams. Students who are absent
without a valid reason will be awarded a zero mark for the component/paper
that they missed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2. Make-up for Termly</strong>  <strong>Weighted Assessment:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make-up assessments will be conducted for students who are absent with
valid reasons only. These will take place on the next school day for termly
weighted assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be no make-up assessments for End-of-Year assessments and Preliminary
Examinations (except for the EL and MTL Oral components).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Punctuality:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are late to school without a valid reason will not be granted
additional time for the assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No extra time will be given to students who are unable to complete their
paper within the stipulated time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Finality of Answers:</strong>
</p>
<p>The answers provided on the answer script (e.g., OAS) will be considered
final.</p>
<p><strong>5. Academic Integrity:</strong>
<br>&nbsp;<strong>a) Prohibited Devices</strong>
<br>Students are strictly prohibited from bringing any unauthorised electronic,
communication, entertainment, or gaming devices into the assessment area.
This includes items capable of capturing, storing, displaying, and/or transmitting
visual, audio, or verbal information. Examples of prohibited devices include,
but are not limited to, mobile phones, cameras, tablets, smart watches/glasses,
and pens with image-capturing capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>b) Cheating</strong>
<br>Possession of any prohibited items or unauthorized notes during an assessment
will be considered an act of cheating. Cheating is treated as a serious
offense. Students found cheating or attempting to cheat in any manner may
be disqualified from the assessment and awarded a <strong>zero</strong> mark
for the paper in addition to other discipline consequences as determined
by the school.</p>
<p><strong>c) Non-Disclosure of Assessment Content</strong>
<br>Students are not allowed to share or disclose any questions or possible
solutions with peers who have not sat for the assessment. This ensures
fairness and integrity for all students taking the assessment. Failure
to do so may be considered an act of cheating.</p>

####  Learning Device Acceptable Use Policy

The Acceptable Use Policy aims to ensure that pupils gain learning opportunities from the school’s online resources safely and effectively.  As part of the 21st Century Skills, digital literacy offers life skills for students to prepare them to be future ready. Cyber wellness will be reinforced to ensure that students learn how to respect self and others in the digital world, and use their devices appropriately.

It is important to understand that learning results from continuous dynamic collaboration among students, educators, parents and stakeholders. The role of the teacher is still vital in technology immersion. Technology in the classroom transforms the teacher to being the facilitator of learning.

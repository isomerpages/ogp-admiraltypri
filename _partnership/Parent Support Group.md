##### Parent Support Group

Our Parent Support Group is a dedicated and supportive group who plays a key role to help create a holistic education for the students.

PSG aims to:

- Promote parents involvement with the school and its programmes by raising awareness of school activities
- Represent parents’ interest
- Enhance communication between school teachers and parents
- Foster educational partnership
- Help advance school’s values and vision
- Be a role model, by demonstrating to your child the importance you place on education
- Provide a feedback channel for the school.

As a PSG member, you will be able to:

- Volunteer your time to design and conduct some school programmes and events. These school programmes and events make the school a safe place for our children to learn in and helps to make school life more vibrant and caring.
- Use your talent to volunteer their expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. This helps to expand the pool of help available to the school.
- Brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve the school.

Other than contributing to the school, our PSG is an active group that is a great support system where you can ask for advice and support from one another.

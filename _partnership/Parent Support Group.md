##### Parent Support Group
Our Parent Support Group is a dedicated and supportive group who plays a key role to help create a holistic education for the students.

PSG aims to: <br>
* promote a collaborative relationship between parents and the School Leaders, teachers and students in the school
* provide opportunities for the parents to volunteer their services using their time and talent in student programmes and co-curricular activities
* provide constructive thoughts (and/or be available for consultation) on school policies and goals, practices and programmes
* support other parents in their parenting journey via suitable avenues

As a PSG member, you will be able to: <br>
* Volunteer your time to design and conduct some school programmes and events. These school programmes and events make the school a safe place for our children to learn in and help to make school life more vibrant and caring.
* Use your talent to volunteer your expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. This helps to expand the pool of help available to the school.
* Brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve the school.

Other than contributing to the school, our PSG is an active group that is a great support system where you can ask for advice and support from one another.

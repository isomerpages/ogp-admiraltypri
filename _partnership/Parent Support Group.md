On behalf of&nbsp;Admiralty Primary PSG, welcome you to&nbsp;our Admiralty Primary family:)

I am Michelle and I have been with the PSG since 2020.
We, as parents, play an important role in our children's life through PSG. Our children get to witness how we contribute to school that directly benefits everyone in school. We get to show as an example all of the moral values that we always remind our children.

As we go along with the school theme 2023, we would like to grow together with you. Should you be keen to join us, please email me at admp.psg@gmail.com.

Once again, A big Thank you for saying yes to PSG :)

Our Parent Support Group is a dedicated and supportive group who plays a key role to help create a holistic education for the students.

PSG aims to:

- Promote parents involvement with the school and its programmes by raising awareness of school activities
- Represent parents’ interest
- Enhance communication between school teachers and parents
- Foster educational partnership
- Help advance school’s values and vision
- Be a role model, by demonstrating to your child the importance you place on education
- Provide a feedback channel for the school.

As a PSG member, you will be able to:

- Volunteer your time to design and conduct some school programmes and events. These school programmes and events make the school a safe place for our children to learn in and helps to make school life more vibrant and caring.
- Use your talent to volunteer their expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. This helps to expand the pool of help available to the school.
- Brainstorm and contribute constructive feedback and ideas to improve the school.

Other than contributing to the school, our PSG is an active group that is a great support system where you can ask for advice and support from one another.

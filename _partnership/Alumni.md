# Admiralty Primary School Alumni Group

A group of passionate alumni started the Admiralty Primary School Alumni Group in 2016. This serves as a platform for graduates of Admiralty Primary School to continue to foster ties with the Admiralty family, promote a true spirit of loyalty and love for the alma mater, fostering a sense of belonging and comradeship amongst former students.

Having a strong alumni is an asset to school as former students help to nurture the school spirit, foster a sense of pride for the school and preserve school traditions. These intangible but fundamental aspects of our school contribute to the formation and development of Admiralty’s identity. All old boys and girls are encouraged to come on-board and join us in making our network a vibrant community to support in achieving the school’s vision.

We would like to encourage all our fellow alumni to register with us and participate our alumni activities and support the School to achieve its education objectives and outcomes. Stay connected through our Admiralty Primary School Alumni Facebook and Instagram which you could learn about the upcoming events and keep in touch with your classmates.

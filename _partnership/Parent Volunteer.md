##### Parent Volunteer

Under the parent volunteer scheme, parents who volunteered their time and effort in a primary school are given an added P1 registration priority.

Parents are required to put in a minimum of 40 hours of service in the primary school of their choice at least one year before their child is due for P1 registration. For example, for a child who is due for P1 registration in 2023, parents will need to complete the 40-hour service in 2022 in order to qualify for Phase 2B to register their child in the primary school.

In Admiralty Primary School, we value our parent volunteers and wish to continue for you to have a long-term partnership with us, even if you have completed the minimum 40 hours. Should your child successfully get a place in our school, we encourage you to sign up with our Parent Support Group (PSG).

Our Parent volunteers will be able to get a chance to volunteer in the following:

- Participate in our school activities such as our in-house events and our greenhouse project
- Help our teachers to take care of our students during their learning journeys
- Supporting our CCAs
- Contributing to the community such as the Chinese New Year Orange Distribution

We would like to encourage parents who are looking forward to securing a spot for their child in our school to join us. Call up the school to find out more!

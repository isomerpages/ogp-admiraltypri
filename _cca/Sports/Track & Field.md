**Introduction**

Admiralty Primary school’s Track & Field CCA was formed in 2012. It’s a CCA were student athletes dare themselves to strive for excellence in an environment that appraise them both physically and mentally.

Under the guidance of our dedicated teachers and coaches, students are trained to compete to the best of their abilities in championships such as the Singapore Sports School Invitational and National Primary school Track and Field.

Through such contests, students can heighten their opportunities to enter established schools which offers Track and Field CCA through Direct School Admission (DSA). Some of these schools are St. Joseph’s Institution (SJI), Cedar Girls’ Secondary School, Nanyang Girls’ High School and even Singapore Sports School.

You can read more on DSA through MOE website.

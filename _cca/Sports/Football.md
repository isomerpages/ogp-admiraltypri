# Football

**Goal**

To further develop student’s passion for football and for them to be advocates of also to teach the students sports for life.

**Objectives**

- To teach and further develop ball mastery in the students.
- To equip students with leadership and character education that will enable them to be a better sportsperson.

**Overview**

Admiralty Football training involves ball skills, strengthening, speed work, plyometric, anaerobic and aerobic training, and endurance training. Activation, co-ordination and ball mastery are the essence of the trainings. These different types of training help the pupils to be stronger, faster and fitter. The values of discipline, dedication and determination are instilled in pupils as they hone their skills to become better players.

**Introduction**

The football programme in Admiralty caters to pupils of all playing levels, from the beginner who wants to learn how to kick a ball, to the nurturing of talents for a potential career in professional football.

The belief in T.E.A.M – Together Everyone Achieves More – is advocated amongst the players.

In Admiralty, we believe that Football is not just about matches and winnings. We want the sport to be an all-rounded platform for the pupils to benefit from. During the suspension of face-to-face CCA sessions, teachers and students embarked on e-CCA and used platforms like SLS, Google Classroom and Google meets to have their training. These weekly sessions not only focused on ball master and other technical/ tactical skills, but also on other important domains such as food and nutrition, leadership and character education. These newly accustomed-to platforms are being utilized continuously to ensure that our pupils have a cut above face-to-face sessions. As a result, our students are more self-directed.

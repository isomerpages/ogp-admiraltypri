**Overview**

Rope Skipping CCA started in 2009. It is a form of exercise that involves swinging a rope around the body and jumping over it as it passes under the feet. It is a cardiovascular training that is beneficial both our physical body and mental mind. Other than being an efficient cardio exercise that benefits our physical body, it also strengthens our full body, boosts bone density, increases agility, improves coordination, trains power and enhances balance. In the area of mental mind, it increases the level of concentration, improves spatial visualization and develops creativity.  

During the weekly CCA sessions, skippers learn rope skipping skills from the professional coaches and are engaged in discussions on learning dispositions and holistic healthy lifestyle.

<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>To cultivate a culture of excellence by instilling discipline, responsibility,
mutual respect and teamwork in students.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To nurture a growth mindset by fostering resilience and building a healthy
competitive spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop confidence and unlock each studentâ€™s potential through the
mastery and showcase of wushu techniques in performances and competitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>During our weekly CCA sessions, students are trained by qualified coaches
to strengthen their mental fortitude and physical stamina. Through progressive
training, students will acquire the necessary skills to perform their assigned
routines such as Fists, Weapons, and Tai Chi. These routines require them
to demonstrate precise coordination of the hands, eyes, and legs as well
as display charisma and confidence through their movements.</p>
<p>Besides technical skills, the Wushu CCA also places strong emphasis on
developing soft skills and character traits such as leadership, resilience,
self-discipline, and diligence. These qualities not only support academic
excellence but also equip students with life skills that will benefit them
beyond their academic years.</p>

<h4>Additional info</h4>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Can my child who has no prior knowledge or experience in Wushu join the CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, we welcome all students who have the passion to join the CCA. Our
professional coaches have years of experience and are able to properly
guide each and every student, regardless of their background.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is it necessary for my child to purchase their own weapons and attire upon joining the CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is not compulsory for students to purchase their own attire and weapons,
but it is highly recommended. As Wushu involves exaggerated body movements,
having the right attire allows students to move more comfortably during
training sessions. The purchase of attire will be done directly through
the coaches.</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to purchase their own weapons upon joining
the CCA. The type of weapon to be purchased will be advised by the coaches
as it depends on the events/routines that the students are assigned to.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My child is not very strong in/is not able to speak Mandarin fluently. Will he/she still be able to join the CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our coaches are able to speak both English and Mandarin. The teachers-in-charge
will also be around to help with translation should there be a need to.</p>

# Wushu
**Goal**

Wushu will create a culture of excellence by instilling discipline, responsibility, mutual respect and cooperation in the spirit of the sport.

**Objectives**

* To encourage a growth mindset coupled with having stretched goals to mold the competitive nature with a ‘Play to Win’ mentality.
* To develop confidence and one’s potential through mastering and exhibiting moves and routines for performances and competitions.

**Overview**

During our weekly CCA sessions, pupils are trained by qualified coaches to develop mental and physical stamina. These enable pupils to acquire the necessary skills to perform their tasked routines. The types of routines include Weapons, Tai Chi and Fists, all of which require precise hand, eye, and leg coordination. Other than the routines, pupils are also trained to express charisma through movements to enhance their stage presence.

Aside from the hard skills that students can acquire, the CCA also emphasizes a lot of developing soft skills like leadership and other positive character traits. Through Wushu, we instill perseverance, diligence and self-discipline in the pupils, which are crucial attitudes that would help them achieve academic excellence. These important life skills will be carried with the pupils and benefit them for a lifetime.

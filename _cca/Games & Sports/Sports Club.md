<h4>Further information</h4>
<p><strong>Q1: What kind of sports can my child learn during CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>There are 3 sports modules spread across 4 terms, namely Badminton, Tchoukball
and Floorball. Sports Club members are exposed to all the 3 sports modules
during CCA sessions to develop their fundamental skills and knowledge of
the sports.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Can my child take part in competitions?</strong>
</p>
<p>Through observations and recommendation by CCA teachers, students will
be identified to specialise for extra trainings to prepare them for school
competition.</p>
<p>Currently, students are only sent for Badminton and Tchoukball competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: Why does my child need to keep a CCA journal for Sports Club?</strong>
</p>
<p>At the end of each CCA session, pupils can reflect on what they have learnt
and jot down notes so that they can reflect on the sports concepts learned
and the skills they need to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: What should my child bring for CCA lessons?</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils can bring a small bag to hold their water bottle to hydrate themselves
and their writing material.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Does my child need to bring any equipment for CCA/training sessions?</strong>
</p>
<p>Badminton rackets and tchoukball equipment for all CCA sessions and extra
trainings will be provided.</p>
<p>For badminton, students can bring their own personal racket.</p>
<p>For Tchoukball, students are encouraged to purchase their own knee pads
for hygiene purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Q6: What is the recommended footwear for training?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to bring along a pair of court shoes as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>it will provide extra support to protect their ankles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it offers grip which will also prevent slipping and injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it uses lightweight materials for students to work on their footwork.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q7: What are the sports that my child can apply for through DSA?</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Q8: What are the schools that my child can apply through DSA that are related to badminton and tchoukball?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents can find out more on schools offering DSA through sports from

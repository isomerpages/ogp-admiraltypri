<h4>CCA Philosophy</h4>
<p>Students will be allocated to the CCA of their choice and embrace the
mindset of flexibility and possibility to stay committed to learn and succeed.
All CCAs aim to be developmental and allow students to learn new skills
that are transferable across the different type of CCAs especially those
that are not offered by the school. Through CCA, students would be able
to experience opportunities to hone their leadership and social skills.
This allows students to be more settled and integrated well in a supportive
school environment. A supportive and consistent environment would be key
in their growth holistically as a student.</p>
<h4>CCA Inclination</h4>
<p>As trials are not conducted in our school, teachers observe the students
and look out for generic attributes that match certain CCAs. These observations
are done over the two years of PAL, PE, Art and Music lessons.</p>
<p>CCA Inclination Letter will issued to parents so that parents/guardians
can guide their child/ward in making an informed decision when selecting
their CCA at the end of Primary 2.</p>
<p>Do note that strong inclination towards a certain group of CCA does not
mean that your child/ward is guaranteed a place in the CCA. However, the
students should consider selecting the CCAs as part of their 3 choices.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>CCA Recruitment</h4>
<p>Selecting a CCA at the end of Primary 2 is a key milestone for our students.
It is an opportunity for our students to exercise their decision making.
Students are required to submit their three different CCA options at end
of Primary 2 as we encourage our students to keep their options open.</p>
<p>In order to help the students make an informed decision, students are
given the opportunity to participate in CCA Immersion so that they can
experience the CCA in an authentic setting. In addition, the school also
organizes the annual CCA Fair so that the students can have conversations
with CCA leaders to have a better understanding of the CCA.</p>
<p>Students would have to consider their options based on their interest
and strengths. While it important for parents to guide the students in
making the decision, the final decision of the choice of CCA should be
made by students and they should take ownership of their own decision.</p>

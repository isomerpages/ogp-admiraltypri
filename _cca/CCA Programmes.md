# CCA
### CCA Philosophy

Students will be allocated to the CCA of their choice and embrace the mindset of flexibility and possibility to stay committed to learn and succeed. 
All CCAs aim to be developmental and allow students to learn new skills that are transferable across the different type of CCAs especially those that are not offered by the school.
Through CCA, students would be able to experience opportunities to hone their leadership and social skills.  This allows students to be more settled and integrated well in a supportive school environment. A supportive and consistent environment would be key in their growth holistically as a student.


**CCA Talent Identification**

As trials are not conducted in our school, observation by teachers during Programme for Active Learning (PAL) lessons is crucial in identifying potential CCA members. Parents/guardians will be informed via a letter if their child/ward has been recommended for any CCA. With the help of the schoolâ€™s recommendations, students would be able to make a responsible decision when selecting their CCA at the end of Primary 2. 


**CCA Recruitment Drive**

Selecting a CCA at the end of Primary 2 is a key milestone for our students. It is an opportunity for our students to exercise their decision making. Students are required to submit their three different CCA options at end of Primary 2 as we encourage our students to keep their options open. 
The conversations with CCA leaders during CCA Recruitment Drive would allow P2 students to have a better understanding of the CCA. With the guidance of the Form Teachers and parents, students would have to consider their options based on their interest and strengths. While it important for parents to guide the students in making the decision, the final decision of the choice of CCA should be made by students and they should take ownership of their own decision.

<p>Admiralty Primary School Guitar Ensemble was started in 2009. Members
apply the school core values of graciousness, responsibility, integrity,
teamwork and grit as they embark on a journey of technical training in
playing the classical guitar as well as ensemble playing skills. The Guitar
Ensemble performs regularly in school as well as in external performances,
allowing the members to showcase their learning at various platforms.</p>

<h5>FAQs:</h5>
<p><strong>Q1. Does my child need to have any musical knowledge in order to join the Guitar Ensemble?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. Every new member will be taught the basics, eg. note-reading, music
scales etc. in their first year of joining the Guitar Ensemble.</p>
<p><strong>Q2. Does my child need to buy a guitar?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. There is no need to purchase a guitar. The school will loan a guitar
to your child. However, we encourage members to purchase their own guitars
by the end of their first year so that they will take greater ownership
of their learning.</p>
<p><strong>Q3. How can I better support my child in his/ her learning to play the guitar?</strong>
</p>
<p>Encourage him/ her to practise at home what he/ she has learnt during
CCA sessions. We recommend our members to practise at least 3 times a week.
Offer him/ her words of encouragement whenever he/ she is struggling to
master a certain skill or song. Allow him/ her to use additional online
resources eg. tutorial videos from YouTube or other web-sites.</p>

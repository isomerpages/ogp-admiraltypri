<p>The Photography Club provides a platform for students to explore photography,
improve their photography skills and take their first steps in developing
a lifelong interest in photography.</p>
<p>Club members learn how to use a range of cameras from compact cameras
to digital single-lens reflex and mirrorless cameras. Members also learn
how to use both manual and autofocus prime lenses in addition to telephoto
lenses and explore the use of light boxes and studio lighting equipment.</p>
<p>They learn to take photographs according to themes, learn about exposure,
ISO, shutter speed, aperture, composition and photo editing using software
tools. Club members get to create presentations and portfolios that showcase
their photographs. They also serve the school by taking photographs during
school events both in school and outside. Selected photographs taken by
pupils are printed, framed and displayed in the school library, and used
in school publications.</p>
<p>Additionally, club members will be given opportunities to develop themselves
as confident photographers who embody the school core values of Graciousness,
Responsibility, Integrity, and Teamwork.</p>

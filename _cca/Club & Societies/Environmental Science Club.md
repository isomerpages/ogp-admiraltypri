<h1>Environmental Science Club</h1><h5>Goal</h5><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To inculcate in pupils a sense of responsibility towards the environment.</p></li><li><p>To cultivate a love for plants and the environment.</p></li><li><p>To educate pupils to enable them to become ambassadors of the green cause.</p></li></ol><h5>Programme Focus</h5><p><strong>Primary 3 / 4 : Love for nature &amp; Biodiversity</strong></p><p>Engaging in early opportunities to play outdoors is connected to both cognitive and physical development. Opportunities to explore the outdoors increases a childâ€™s knowledge of the natural world. It also helps them make connections to their environment around them and to learn to love the nature. Students experience and explore planting using different methods during this stage of their CCA journey.</p><p>Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. Humans depend on living things in various ecosystems in a myriad of ways. Some are fairly obvious, others more complex. Students explore different types of biodiversity to understand the interaction between organisms.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/SciENV2.png"></div><p><strong>Primary 5 / 6 : Outreach</strong></p><p>Confident environmental activists in-the-making is the hope and aspiration for our students. They are given the opportunities to engage in conversations with our school population and members of the public to share about the green ways of living, making contributions and giving back to society in their own way.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/SciENV11.png"></div><h5>Teachers-in-Charge</h5><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Mdm.

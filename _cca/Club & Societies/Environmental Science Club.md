**Goal**

1. To inculcate in pupils a sense of responsibility towards the environment.
2. To cultivate a love for plants and the environment.
3. To educate pupils to enable them to become ambassadors of the green cause.


**Programme focus for 2021:**

**Primary 3: Cultivate love for nature**

Engaging in early opportunities to play outdoors is connected to both cognitive and physical development. Opportunities to explore the outdoors increases a child’s knowledge of the natural world. It also helps them make emotional connections with the environment around them and learn to love the nature. Students experience and explore planting using different methods at this stage of their CCA journey. 

**Primary 4: Biodiversity**

Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. Humans depend on living things in various ecosystems in a myriad of ways. Some are fairly obvious, some are more complex. Students explore different types of biodiversity in Singapore and overseas, to understand the interaction between organisms at this stage of their CCA journey. 

**Primary 5/6: Outreach**

Confident environmental activist in-the-making is our hope and aspiration for this group of students. They are given the opportunities to engage in conversations with our school population and members of the public to share about their green way of living, making contribution and giving back to the society in their own way.

### Goal

- To enable pupils to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.
- To nurture pupils to be confident, tech-savvy and responsible digital learners.

### Objectives

Pupils will be able to:

1. Acquire new information and technology skills and knowledge through the CCA modules
2. Apply the relevant skills acquired by taking part in Infocomm Technology.
3. Contribute their knowledge and skills learnt to the school through school project collaborations with other CCA or committees

### Overview

Our Infocomm Technology modules include :

1. Website Design (Dreamweaver)
2. Digital Art (Photoshop)
3. Python (Basic Programming)
4. Animation
5. Robocup Cospace
6. MicroBit
7. Moway (Scratch)

Pupils will also apply the knowledge and skills acquired through the Website Design to create and build their own electronic portfolio. This e-portfolio is used to store their projects, photos and other school-related work over the years. It will also serve as a tool for DSA application whereby the pupil can use their e-portfolio to display their work.

### Additional info

- CCA lessons will be conducted in our school computer labs (Google Lab 1 & 2) from 7.40am to 9.40am every Monday.
- The CCA Leaders will issue each pupil with a device. Types of devices used will be based on the module requirements. There is no need for pupils to bring their own device during their CCA lessons.
- Pupils are required to bring their own thumb drive to store their work or project. This will enable the pupils to access or edit their work at home.
- Infocomm Technology welcome all pupils who are interested to join our CCA. We hope to create meaningful ICT-enabled student-centric learning experiences for all our members.

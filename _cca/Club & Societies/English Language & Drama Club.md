# English Language &amp; Drama Club
The English Language &amp; Drama Club provides opportunities for pupils to develop a lifelong passion for the language through games and drama. Besides engaging in mindful play like Scrabble, students also learn about the various drama techniques of vocal variety, voice projection, facial and spatial awareness, tableau, improvisation etc. 

Students are also involved in stagecraft; staging and production processes that include scriptwriting, stage managing (use of space and behind the scenes work e.g., sounds and lighting) and directing.
Students’ knowledge on stagecraft will be deepened through learning journeys to MediaCorp / Wild Rice Theatre as they get to experience first-hand, what goes on behind the scenes of these theatres.

**Objectives**

Pupils will be able to :

1. Acquire acting and stagecraft (scriptwriting, stage managing &amp; directing) skills
2. Explore, experiment and express themselves using the drama techniques
3. Develop social and emotional competencies while working together to achieve a common creative goal 
4. Apply strategic thinking and decision-making skills during competitions, performances, or activities carried out during CCA.

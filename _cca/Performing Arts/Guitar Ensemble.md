### Guitar Ensemble

Admiralty Primary School Guitar Ensemble was started in 2009. Members apply the school core values of graciousness, responsibility, integrity, teamwork and grit as they embark on a journey of technical training in playing the classical guitar as well as ensemble playing skills. The Guitar Ensemble performs regularly in school as well as in external performances, allowing the members to showcase their learning at various platforms.

##### FAQs:

1. Does my child need to have any musical knowledge in order to join the Guitar Ensemble?

**No. Every new member will be taught the basics, eg. note-reading, music scales etc. in their first year of joining the Guitar Ensemble.**

2. Does my child need to buy a guitar?

**No. There is no need to purchase a guitar. The school will loan a guitar to your child. However, we encourage members to purchase their own guitars by the end of their first year so that they will take greater ownership of their learning.**

3. How can I better support my child in his/ her learning to play the guitar?

**Encourage him/ her to practise at home what he/ she has learnt during CCA sessions. We recommend our members to practise at least 3 times a week.
Offer him/ her words of encouragement whenever he/ she is struggling to master a certain skill or song. Allow him/ her to use additional online resources eg. tutorial videos from YouTube or other web-sites.**

## Choir

##### Goals

**WE SING AS ONE!**

The primary goal of Choir is to enrich the 
lives of participating students and their
audience, by meanings of rehearsing and 
performing high quality music. We wish to 
keep alive high standards of artistic 
excellence and the spirit of joy when our 
students gather together to sing or to hear 
beautiful music. 

##### Objectives

Our objectives are to help our students grow musically with a well-rounded and enriched singing education. Through proper vocal training, ear training, learning general music theory and terminology, and by striving for the highest quality performance within the various musical styles, we hope our students will join us with an enthusiastic heart to singing and acquiring new knowledge.

We also aim to cultivate:
* a sense of responsibility
* teamwork
* commitment
* self-discipline
* confidence in performing and 
* poise 
which are key ingredients for success in 
any field

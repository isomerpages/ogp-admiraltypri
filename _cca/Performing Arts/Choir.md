WE SING AS ONE! 

 

Comprising choristers from Primary 3 to Primary 6, Admiralty Choir provides a fun and supportive environment that motivates and inspires singers to pursue their passion in choral singing.

 

Through a holistic choral training programme, our student choristers join a CCA where they get to hone their vocal abilities and discover unique performing opportunities. They gain invaluable experiences by engaging themselves in activities such as choir exchanges, workshops, learning journeys and national performances. 

 

By the end of 4 years of CCA experiences with us, our choristers are able to appreciate fine music, develop essential interpersonal skills like cooperation, teamwork, self-discipline and responsibility and possess a positive attitude towards striving for excellence.

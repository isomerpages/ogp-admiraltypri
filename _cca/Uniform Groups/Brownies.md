<h4>Brownies are 7 to 12 year old girls who enjoy learning and having amazing adventures together!</h4>

more independent.</p>

activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and
do in the future.</p>

Brownies do fun things together with other Brownie or Girl Guide units
for joint learning adventures!</p>

<p>learning to care for each other and other people around them and make
lasting friendships.</p>

<h4>About</h4>
<p>Admiralty Primary Schoolâ€™s Brownie unit was formed in 1997. We have grown
steadily in strength from a mere 20 members to the current 58-odd members.
Girls are interested to join Brownies because we offer them opportunities
to novel experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each brownie will go through our unique 5-point programme with various
modules;</p>

<li>
<p>Each module prepares them with the necessary skills to fulfill their Brownie
Promise and Law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The girls are empowered with the skills to lead and take the initiative
to lead others towards a positive change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Brownie unit, a divisional unit of the Girl Guides Singapore (GGS),
is part of a global movement that covers 150 countries around the world
with a strong foundation of 100 years in Singapore itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our aim for our Brownies is that each girl should reach her highest potential.
They do this by achieving badges, through the completion of the modules,
and challenging themselves to go beyond and attain the proficiency badges.
The most deserving girls have an opportunity to aim for the highest award
for a Brownie as well, the Chief Commissioners Award.</p>

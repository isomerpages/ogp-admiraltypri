### Brownies
Admiralty Primary School’s Brownie unit was formed in 1997. We have grown steadily in strength from a mere 20 members to the current 40-odd members. Girls are interested to join Brownies because we offer them opportunities to novel experiences. 
 
Each brownie will go through our unique 5-point programme with various modules;
1. personal and social development,
2. home,
3. outdoors,
4. community, and
5. international.

Each module prepares them with the necessary skills to fulfill their Brownie Promise and Law. The girls are empowered with the skills to lead and take the initiative to lead others towards a positive change. Our Brownie unit, a divisional unit of the Girl Guides Singapore (GGS), is part of a global movement that covers 150 countries around the world with a strong foundation of 100 years in Singapore itself. This year, our movement has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for global contribution towards peace and dialogue. 
 
Our aim for our Brownies is that each girl should reach her highest potential. They do this by achieving badges, through the completion of the modules, and challenging themselves to go beyond and attain the proficiency badges. The most deserving girls have an opportunity to aim for the highest award for a Brownie as well, the Chief Commissioners Award.

Since 2012, Admiralty Primary School’s Brownie unit has been consistently awarded the Puan Noor Aishah (PNA) Award from GGS. We have made steady progress from a bronze award to silver award and for the past few years, gold award. It represents our unit’s active participation in programmes and activities run at division and national levels. We are confident that with the enthusiasm of the girls, support of our parents and motivation from our school leaders, we will be able to take our unit to the next level.

<br>The National Day Parade (NDP) in Singapore is a significant event that commemorates the nation's independence. Celebrations are not only confined to the main parade but also extend to various aspects of Singaporean society, including schools. In Admiralty Primary School, we make a point to commemorate the event with our uniform groups. By allowing our Scouts to participate in this event, it reinforces a sense of patriotism and national identity among students. It helps instill a strong sense of pride in being a Singaporean and fosters a connection to the nation's history and values.

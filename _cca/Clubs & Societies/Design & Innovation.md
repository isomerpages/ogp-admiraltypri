<p>Join the Design and Innovation Club to explore, discover, and lead innovation
through hands-on activities that spark curiosity and creative thinking.
By embracing a willingness to try new ideas—even when there's a risk of
failure—you will learn to tackle complex problems using design thinking.
Our teachers and CCA members model the innovative mindsets we aim to develop,
making this CCA the optimal place to grow as a leader in innovation.</p>
<h4>The objectives of the Design and Innovation Club are to:</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teach students the five stages of Design Thinking: Empathy, Define, Ideate,
Prototype, and Test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to apply these stages through mini
projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with critical thinking, communication, inventive thinking,
and teamwork skills for managing innovative projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop effective problem-solving abilities in students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Join us to enhance your skills and become a Leader in Innovation!</p>

<h4>Programme Focus</h4>
<p><strong>Primary 3 / 4 :</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 and 4 pupils participate in modular-based programmes that
emphasize creative problem-solving and the design thinking model.</p>

<p>In this module, the Primary 3 pupils were introduced to microcontrollers
like the Micro:Bit. After learning how to code the Micro:Bit, the pupils
had fun making mini projects like a burglar alarm and designing a game.</p>
<p>Besides Digital Making, the pupils also tinkered with Analogue Making
using recycled paper. Inspired by the innovation of aircraft, the pupils
made different models of paper airplanes and observed how the structure
of the airplane affects its flight.</p>
<p>They shared their love for innovation by conducting Makerspace activities
for their fellow Admirals, teaching them how to fold paper airplanes that
can stay afloat longer.</p>

<p>Our Primary 4 pupils showcased their creativity and ingenuity by participating
in the Sony Creative Science Award, a toy-making competition, where they
crafted imaginative and unique toys. They eagerly shared their insights
and experiences with their Primary 3 juniors, inspiring the next generation
of young innovators to dream big and think creatively.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 5 / 6 : </strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 pupils are given the opportunity to participate in IvP (a
module by GEP Branch). IvP is an eight-month programme where students learn
the skills for problem finding, generation of creative ideas, prototyping
&amp; testing of solutions. The programme aims to stimulate students’ curiosity
to understand the problem at hand &amp; encourage them to embrace experimentation
in generating &amp; testing potential solutions.</p>

<h4>Get ready for an exciting change in 2025!</h4>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Staring in 2025, the Environmental Science and Design
and Innovation co-curricular activities (CCAs) will be merging. The combined
CCA will be known as Design &amp; Innovation.</p>
<p>This newly merged club will not only spark creativity and innovation but
also lead the charge in eco-sustainability. We’re taking our passion for
design and innovation to the next level—focusing on creating solutions
that benefit the environment. Together, we’ll combine environmental science
and innovation to design a greener, more sustainable future. Join us in
making a difference!</p>

# Design &amp; Innovation
**Objectives**

- To enable students to learn and understand the five stages of Design Thinking.
- To enable the students to apply the five stages of Design Thinking  (includes Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test) through a series of mini projects.
- To prepare students with relevant critical thinking skills, communication skills, inventive thinking skills and team collaborative skill in managing the innovative projects.
- To be effective problem-solvers.

**Goal**

- Encourage pupils to learn by trying and experimenting.
- Pupils create lightweight structures based on STEAM based lessons.
- Encourage creativity by coding, creating confidence and hands-on prototyping.
- Help develop complex problem-solving, critical thinking and creative thinking skills.

At the core of it, Innovation Club focusses on activities that develop curiosity and asking questions to explore, discover and learn something new. Innovation is about the willingness to try and explore a wider terrain of ideas, even if there is risk of failure. To awaken and nurture the spirit of innovation, our teachers model the attitudes and habits of mind we seek to develop in our students.

Our Primary 3 &amp; 4 pupils will be engaged in creative problem-solving process and design thinking model through our programmes that are modular based.

Our Primary 5 pupils are given the opportunity to participate in IvP (a module by GEP Branch). IvP is an eight-month programme where students learn the skills for problem finding, generation of creative ideas, prototyping &amp; testing of solutions. The programme aims to stimulate students' curiosity to understand the problem at hand &amp; encourage them to embrace experimentation in generating &amp; testing potential solutions.

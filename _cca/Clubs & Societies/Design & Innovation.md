<p>Join the Design and Innovation Club to explore, discover, and lead innovation
through hands-on activities that spark curiosity and creative thinking.
By embracing a willingness to try new ideas—even when there's a risk of
failure—you will learn to tackle complex problems using design thinking.
Our teachers and CCA members model the innovative mindsets we aim to develop,
making this CCA the optimal place to grow as a leader in innovation.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Design and Innovation Club are to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teach students the five stages of Design Thinking: Empathy, Define, Ideate,
Prototype, and Test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to apply these stages through mini
projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with critical thinking, communication, inventive thinking,
and teamwork skills for managing innovative projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop effective problem-solving abilities in students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Join us to enhance your skills and become a Leader in Innovation!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Programme Focus</p>
<p>Primary 3 / 4 :</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 and 4 pupils participate in modular-based programmes that
emphasize creative problem-solving and the design thinking model.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encourage pupils to learn by trying and experimenting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pupils create lightweight structures based on STEAM based lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage creativity by coding, creating confidence and hands-on prototyping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help develop complex problem-solving, critical thinking and creative thinking
skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the core of it, Innovation Club focusses on activities that develop
curiosity and asking questions to explore, discover and learn something
new. Innovation is about the willingness to try and explore a wider terrain
of ideas, even if there is risk of failure. To awaken and nurture the spirit
of innovation, our teachers model the attitudes and habits of mind we seek
to develop in our students.</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 &amp; 4 pupils will be engaged in creative problem-solving
process and design thinking model through our programmes that are modular
based.</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 pupils are given the opportunity to participate in IvP (a
module by GEP Branch). IvP is an eight-month programme where students learn
the skills for problem finding, generation of creative ideas, prototyping
&amp; testing of solutions. The programme aims to stimulate students' curiosity
to understand the problem at hand &amp; encourage them to embrace experimentation
in generating &amp; testing potential solutions.</p>

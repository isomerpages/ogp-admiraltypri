<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>The English Language Department is focused in developing our pupils to
be confident and articulate speakers, having the ability and skills to
achieve critical visual media literacy, and to be able to be avid readers
and inspired writers.</p>
<p>Our pupils apply the 21st century skills of communication, critical and
creative thinking and collaboration in their lessons and various oral presentations
in class as well.</p>
<p>The pupils’ effective use of the English language is achieved through
a strong foundation and rich language for all. The department adheres closely
to this approach in the teaching of English, using the EL 2020 Syllabus
as a guide.</p>
<h4>English Syllabus and Programmes:</h4>

<h4>Literature</h4>
<p>To further infuse creative and critical thinking skills in the learning
of English Language, we have introduced literature to our pupils.</p>
<p>Through the Literature Programme from Primary One to Six, pupils gain
an awareness and are opened to appreciate multiple perspectives through
the study of texts from different parts of the world. Upon appreciating
the contexts in which the literary texts are written, pupil then respond
to the texts by giving their personal responses to different themes, for
example on family, sibling rivalry, society and gender biasness. There
is also an attempt to develop our pupils to be confident and empathetic
towards others, both socially and culturally, through character studies
in the texts.</p>
<p>The active engagement in classroom teaching between teacher and pupils
during text analysis further develops communications skills and good language
use through dialogues and writing.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>
<p>For teaching to be effective, teachers will identify and monitor pupils’
changing needs, abilities and interests so that they can modify or adapt
their teaching methods to help pupils and provide them with opportunities
to act on the feedback to improve their learning. Teachers will align assessment
with the aims and learning outcomes in the syllabus. The pupils will be
assessed formally and informally using different modes of assessment so
that a wide range of skills, learner strategies, attitudes and behaviour
can be developed, and the items and structures can be learned.</p>
<p>The range of assessment modes and tasks include quizzes and informal assessments.
Informal performance assessments include assessing students’ skills in
carrying out an activity, e.g. Show and Tell, Pick and Talk, an oral presentation,
Book Talk as well as free writing and journals which depict students’ reflections.</p>

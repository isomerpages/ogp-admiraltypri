**Student Leaders’ Investiture 2021**

The Student Leaders Investiture was held online via zoom on 4th March 2021, Thursday from 10 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. .
Led by our Head Prefect, Darsh of 6GR, the student leaders pledged to serve the school to their best of our abilities. As Student Leaders, they champion our school core values and strive to meet the challenges, the expectations and in the process, inspire their peers, to be the best that they can be.
As they leave behind the turbulent year of 2020, and face the new norms in 2021, they will have many ups and downs but they can be our beacon of hope and a source of encouragement as all of us keep moving forward.
In Admiralty Primary School, we believe that every pupil can be developed as a leader. Being a good leader is not only about showing the right way but also walking the right way. Student Leaders are selected based on their exemplary leadership qualities and have maintained the highest standards of behaviour. The student leaders will take on higher leadership roles and work closely with the staff and stakeholders in leading school events and programmes. The school is confident that these young leaders will lead, with great commitment and be ambassadors, who will portray the traits of GRIT of Admiralty Primary School.
Congratulations to all the appointed Student Leaders of 2021!

#### Physical Education (PE) for Life


**Competent Movers, Confident Participants, Committed Advocates of Active & Healthy Living**

1.  We want our students to be competent in their PE skills so that they are more confident to pursue and be engaged in physical activities for life. 
2.  They understand and are able to make the right decision about their health.   

 
**Students will learn the following domains:**

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

**PE for Life - Practising skills beyond class**  
  

Physical education has the potential to make distinctive contributions to the development of children’s fundamental movement skills and physical competencies, which are necessary precursors of participation in later lifestyle and sporting physical activities. 

We strongly encourage our students to practise their PE skills beyond lessons and even school. Students can explore various creative ways to master the skill sets taught at their own time.

We also infuse the use of ICT in our teaching and learning of PE. The students have the opportunity to use their own learning devices for video recording and evaluation of their skill performances during their formative assessment. 

**PE for Life - Journaling**  
  
Every student keeps a PE Journal. This allows them to reflect and articulate their learning during and beyond Physical Education lessons. Students also ask questions to clarify any doubt they may have. Teachers would use the reflections to guide and develop the students’ PE skills and address concerns that the students may have.

We also provide our students the following opportunities and experiences to enjoy active and healthy living.  

*   Play@Lunch
*   National Day Games 
*   Virtual Run
*   SwimSafer
*   Adventure Camp

#### Aesthetics

Appreciate the Arts through a Learned Lens  

Admiralty Primary School adapts the Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) framework in our Aesthetics curricula to bring about a deep and powerful arts teaching and learning. Our students analyse perspectives  in the arts through essential questions such as “What is the artist’s voice?” and "What is the role of art/the artists/the audience?".  

You may refer to Ministry of Education’s Art and Music syllabi here.

**Artist Practice**

In Art, our students have their own sketchbooks for them to document their research and exploration. 

They also use the sketchbooks to refine their ideas and skills before proceeding with their final artwork. This get students to experience the practice of an artist and understand what goes behind creating an artwork.

Dear parents,

Thank you for standing by your child and supporting schools through the HBL period!

With the upcoming holidays, your child will be spending more time at home. This presents you with the opportunity to deepen your relationship with your child and bond more as a family. By making small changes to what you say and do, you can relate better to your child, and equip them with the much needed support and positive attitude needed for life.

This issue of Parent Kit provides you with tips on how you can frame your conversations with your child positively, and things you can do to guide your child to become mentally and emotionally resilient. It also suggests ways in which your family (your child included) can bond while showing care for each other.

**Full Home-Based Learning – Apr 9, 2020**

Dear parents,

In line with the Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s latest efforts to further enhance safe distancing measures. **From 8 April 2020, all MOE schools will shift to full Home-Based Learning (HBL) till 4 May 2020.**

During the period of full HBL, we will provide instructions and support for your children to access a range of both online and hardcopy HBL resources so that learning can continue. Your child’s teachers will inform you of this week’s teaching plan by 3pm tomorrow and subsequent teaching plan on a previous Saturday (before 3pm).

If your child needs learning or emotional support, he/she can approach our teachers and other school personnel such as our allied educators and school counsellors, who will continue to work from home or from school. Our teachers will also be in regular contact with you and your child.

All school-based Mid-Year Examinations will be cancelled. However, national examinations, including Year-End Examinations and Primary School Leaving Examinations will proceed as planned and with the necessary precautionary measures in place.

Our teachers will continue to monitor the progress of your child through HBL assignments, such as feedback given via google classroom, Zoom, SLS or Onenote.

Please ensure that your child stays at home and continues to observe good hygiene practices such as washing their hands frequently with soap. Temperature taking should be done once a day with the temperature readings submitted online. Your child’s form teacher will be in touch with you on how this can be done. If your child feels unwell, please seek medical attention promptly and inform his/her form teacher if he/she displays any fever or flu-like symptoms.

We plan to resume classes on 5 May 2020. MOE will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation to assess if HBL needs to be extended. We urge you to rely on official sources of information and not to circulate any unconfirmed information. If you have any further queries, please contact our General Office at 63620598.

Thank you and keep safe!

Yours sincerely

Pek Wee Haur

Principal

Dear parents,

From 1 Apr 2020, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model, starting with one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week.

Our students are familiar with HBL as our school had conducted at least 3 HBL-related sessions as stated below:

-1 to 30 Sept 2019: Familiarisation with SLS (Phase 1)

-Term 4, 2019: FTGP Lesson on Cyberwellness via SLS

-17 to 21 Feb 2020: Familiarisation with SLS (Phase 2)

This issue of Parent Kit provides tips on how you can support your child’s HBL and addresses some of your concerns.

### Objectives
**Vision**

Nurturing Passionate Learners in Mother Tongue Language

The Chinese Language Unit believes that language give learners the world by opening their minds to other cultures and opening doors to new possibilities. While learning the language, it takes learners on a journey that improves the way they communicate, interact with others, and engage with learning – and with life – at home and beyond.

We believe that through the acquisition of Chinese language and intercultural skills, our students at school will ignite their passion for the language, in turn, equipping them with confidence in the language. 

### Programmes and Activities

The Chinese curriculum in our school aims to cultivate the students in three main areas:

1. Language abilities
2. Values and culture
3. Communication skills

_(Quoted from 2015 Syllabus, Chinese Language, Primary, MOE)

With the curriculum framework in mind, the unit planned and crafted programmes that will nurture passionate learners in the Mother Tongue language.

**Key Programmes**

* Literature programme
* Poem recitation and appreciation
* Mother Tongue Ambassadors
* Cross Cultural Programme
* P3 Cultural Camp
* Heritage trails 
* Cultural Performance Exposure
* Festivals celebrations

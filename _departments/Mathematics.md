<h4>Teaching and Learning Processes</h4>
<h5>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach</h5>
<p>In Admiralty Primary, we provide meaningful learning experiences to bring
about deep learning where students learn to transfer their knowledge and
skills to solve complex problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in teaching and
learning, students learn to make connections and meanings with the more
abstract concepts. Students use concrete materials like interlocked cubes,
fraction discs and other materials to help them understand the concepts.
Students also learn to draw models and see the connection between these
models and their related equations.</p>

</div>
<h5>Development of metacognition</h5>
<p>In Math lessons, students are encouraged to develop their reasoning and
metacognitive skills. Metacognition is the awareness and regulation of
one’s thinking. Students are often exposed to non-routine or open-ended
problems so that they learn to decide on the problem-solving strategies
to be used. Checking for the reasonableness of their answers and thinking
through the logic of their solutions are also part of the metacognitive
processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some of the students’ metacognitive responses to the Math tasks.</p>

<h5>Problem-solving strategies</h5>
<p>Students will face with problems coming from everyday contexts or in future
work situations. Having developed a wide repertoire of problem-solving
skills and critical thinking, students will then be able to apply their
knowledge to solve complex and non-routine tasks. Some of the general problem-solving
strategies will include the Polya’s problem solving strategy and the use
of heuristics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Polya’s 4-Step Problem Solving</strong>
</p>
<p>George Polya was a mathematician in the 1940s. He devised a systematic
process for solving problems that is now referred to by his name, the Polya
4-Step Problem-Solving Process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polya’s 4-step is used to guide our students to systematically approach
and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;<strong>Understand</strong>&nbsp;the problem</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read the problem carefully to understand what is required in the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw or write down the information given in the problem in a simpler form&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2:&nbsp;<strong>Plan</strong>&nbsp;what to do/Devise a plan</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose a strategy to use to solve the problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Do</strong>&nbsp;it/Carry out the plan</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Carry out your plan to solve the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Check</strong>&nbsp;the solution</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check the reasonableness of your solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek alternative solutions&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The common&nbsp;<strong>Heuristics</strong>&nbsp;to solve problems also
include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make a systematic listing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guess and check / Make a supposition or assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for a pattern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work backwards&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model drawing</strong>&nbsp;is an important problem-solving strategy
that enables students to translate information of the given problem into
a pictorial form which aid students’ understanding of the problem. As the
students advance in Math learning, the more complex problem sums can be
broken down using model drawing. Students learn to visualize different
parts of the information to see how the parts are related to one another
to form a larger pattern. Many of the more complex model drawings are permutations
from the basic part-whole and comparison models from the lower primary.
Therefore, it is an essential problem-solving skill that will anchor the
students’ problem-solving competency.</p>

<h5>Learn-with-Technology tasks</h5>
<p>In the digital era, students must be equipped with the necessary knowledge,
skills, and dispositions to thrive in an interconnected, diverse, and rapidly
changing world. The secondary and higher learning institution students
have been learning through a mix of home-based and in-school activities,
and leverage both online and offline approaches to learning. In Admiralty
Primary, we would like to prepare our students early for this blended learning
experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn-with-Technology (LwT) task is the meaningful incorporation of technology
in daily teaching and learning. It is a shift in the learning culture that
provides our students with more opportunities to learn at their own pace,
and there is dedicated time and space to allow them to pursue their own
interests and learn outside of the curriculum.</p>
<p>LwT tasks also go beyond the classrooms with the intentional extension
of topics from daily classroom teaching to e-learning on designated days
and school holidays. Students are encouraged to explore the affordances
of technology to represent and present what they have discovered and learnt.
The LwT routines for Math were built up from the lower primary years.</p>

</div>
<h5>Differentiated Instructions</h5>
<p>At Admiralty Primary, we believe that every child can learn Math. The
department provides additional support to the students who need more guidance
and help in learning Math through specialized early intervention programmes
like&nbsp;<strong>Learning Support for Math (LSM).</strong>
</p>
<p>LSM is an early intervention effort that provides additional support to
students who do not have the necessary foundational numeracy skills and
knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. Students who
need such early intervention are identified at the beginning of their Primary
1 education. Specially trained LSM teachers are assigned to teach and guide
these students. The LSM lessons are structured with lots of hands-on work
with concrete materials and factual fluency to strengthen the Math foundation
of the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students are grouped into smaller groups so that each student would
receive more personal attention from the LSM teachers, and these students
focus on small successes to build on their motivation to learn Math. There
are regular check points to assess the students’ learning. Students who
improve and cope better with the foundational numeracy skills and knowledge
will ultimately graduate from the LSM programme. Students who still need
such support after their lower primary years will continue to be supported
at their mid-primary years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who have a passion in learning Math are given opportunities to
further develop and strengthen their math reasoning skills with the incorporation
of&nbsp;<strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K)</strong>&nbsp;Math resources in their
math lessons. The students learn to deepen their conceptual understanding
through an inquiry approach. They work either independently or collaborate
with their peers in mathematical explorations such as games and puzzles
as well as mathematical investigations. Such tasks are usually open-ended
in nature to facilitate the thinking, reasoning, and to raise students’
awareness that not all math problems have a fixed one answer solution.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Formative assessments</h5>
<p><strong>Primary 1 &amp; 2</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been no weighted assessments for Primary 1 and 2 students since
2019 when MOE removed all mid-year and year-end examinations for the lower
primary years to encourage schools to assess students holistically. In
line with the holistic assessment, Admiralty Primary uses&nbsp;<strong>subject specific learning outcomes</strong>&nbsp;(LO)
and&nbsp;<strong>qualitative feedback</strong>&nbsp;to report&nbsp;<strong>Primary 1 and 2 students’ progress</strong>&nbsp;at
the end of Semester 1 and 2. These holistic reports which provide overall
feedback to parents on the learning progress will also include recommended
strategies on how parents could help and support their students’ learning
at home. Admiralty Primary recognises the importance of building students’
confidence and intrinsic motivation to learn at an early age. All these
changes build on efforts to inculcate the joy of learning, subject mastery
and self-discovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Primary 3 to Primary 6</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our teaching and learning processes, teachers plan and execute
their lessons with clear learning intentions that are aligned with the
relevant instructional pedagogy to bring about meaningful learning experiences.
Teachers also gather evidence of students’ learning so that they could
rectify any misconceptions and bridge emerging learning gaps. Assessment
is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. At Admiralty
Primary, we believe in a balanced assessment system which includes summative
and formative assessments. While it is essential to ascertain the competency
of a student at a certain point of learning in the form of a paper-and-pen
test, it is equally important to monitor the student’s learning and involve
students in peer or self-assessment as part of their daily learning process.</p>
<h4>Assessments</h4>
<h5>Weighted assessments</h5>
<p><strong>Primary 3 to 6 Weighted Assessments</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2020, there have been no mid-year examinations (MYE) for Primary
3 and Primary 5 students, and MYE for Primary 4 students was also removed
in 2022. Therefore, Primary 3 to Primary 5 students will have weighted
assessments (WA) for terms 2 and 3, and End-of-Year Examination (EOY Exam)
in Term 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary 6 students will have their term 2 WA and continue to have their
Preliminary Examination in Term 3. All Primary 6 pupils will sit for the
Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) at the end of their primary education.
Posting to secondary school will be based only on the PSLE results.</p>
<p>In addition to the term WA, Admiralty Primary also includes Performance
Assessments on Math Journaling and Performance Task (P3) as part of the
weighted assessments. The purpose of incorporating these alternative tasks
is to provide opportunities for students to engage more deeply in mathematical
thinking, applying practical skills and reasoning in authentic tasks. This
approach offers a more holistic assessment of students' overall mathematical
competency throughout the year and helps reduce test anxiety by not relying
solely on traditional written tests.</p>

<h4>Department Programme</h4>
<h5>KooBits programme</h5>
<p>Admiralty Primary has engaged an online math learning portal from Singapore,
KooBits Problem Sums, as an additional learning resource for our students.
This portal is developed to help build problem-solving skills in our students
and to promote self-directed learning. Our students can access Self-Practice,
Homework, Mock Tests in the system, and be engaged in daily activities
and Math games to earn points and win prizes. This technology-assisted
learning platform is used to promote independent and self-directed learning.</p>
<p></p>
<h5>Family Math</h5>
<p>Family Math activities are designed to engage families in the students’
learning experiences outside of school. Families are well positioned to
talk about quantity, counting, shapes, patterns, and other math concepts
at home, in the parks, or during grocery shopping. Family Math is usually
conducted during June holidays. Through the activities, students take part
in experiential learning that involves explorations, journaling, hands-on
activities, quizzes, and games. Family members get together to do fun hands-on
activities that allow the students to learn through real life experiences
alongside with their families. The parents enjoy these meaningful bonding
moments with their children and the children are also more motivated to
take ownership of their own learning. The variety of activities also give
parents a greater insight into their children’s learning.</p>

<h5>Math@Lunch</h5>
<p>Math@Lunch is conducted once every term during lunch hour near the canteen
area to foster interest in Math. Our students get to experience different
Math-related activities such as Math video screening, games, and quizzes
after enjoying their meals. The objective of the programme is to encourage
students to do Mathematics outside the classroom and to inculcate their
interest in using Mathematics through the fun activities. Students get
to play various digital Math games or hands-on manipulatives such as number
cards, tangrams, and board games. They can also win tokens by participating
in the booth challenge or online quizzes.</p>

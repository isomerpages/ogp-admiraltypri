#### Teaching and Learning Processes

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach** <br>

In Admiralty Primary, we provide meaningful learning experiences to bring about deep learning where students learn to transfer their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. 

Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in teaching and learning, students learn to make connections and meanings with the more abstract concepts. Students use concrete materials like interlocked cubes, fraction discs and other materials to help them understand the concepts. Students also learn to draw models and see the connection between these models and their related equations.

#### Teaching and Learning Processes

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach** <br>

In Admiralty Primary, we provide meaningful learning experiences to bring about deep learning where students learn to transfer their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. 

Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in teaching and learning, students learn to make connections and meanings with the more abstract concepts. Students use concrete materials like interlocked cubes, fraction discs and other materials to help them understand the concepts. Students also learn to draw models and see the connection between these models and their related equations.

**Development of metacognition** <br>

In Math lessons, students are encouraged to develop their reasoning and metacognitive skills. Metacognition is the awareness and regulation of one’s thinking. Students are often exposed to non-routine or open-ended problems so that they learn to decide on the problem-solving strategies to be used. Checking for the reasonableness of their answers and thinking through the logic of their solutions are also part of the metacognitive processes. 

**Below are some of the students’ metacognitive responses to the Math tasks.**

**Task:**<br>
**Which are the prime numbers from 1 to 30?**<br>
I determined the prime numbers by removing all the multiples that involved numbers other than 1 and themselves. In total, there were 12 prime numbers in the set of 30 numbers.

**Find a different way to identify the winner of the completed game of Reversi.**<br>
The winner is the person who manages to acquire the most number of pieces at the end of the game. Other than counting the black or white pieces individually to determine the winner, a more efficient method is to group the discs into multiple groups of equal black and white discs. There are two remaining white discs after the grouping. This means the winner is the person holding the WHITE pieces.

**Purpose of the task:** <br>
* Using tools or items around us to help us make closer estimates to the real values.

**Math understanding:** <br>
* Concept of estimation
* Concept of measurements

Select or pick a tree near your house or school. Explain and show clearly how you would be able to estimate the height of the tree. Take a picture of the tree with the item or tools of reference you are using.

**Responses:** <br>
The tree outside my HDB flat is about 2½ times of a level. A level in my HDB is about 4 m in height based on the research of the architecture rule in Singapore. I add the height of two levels and ½ of a level to estimate the height of the tree.

#### Problem-solving strategies  
Students will face with problems coming from everyday contexts or in future work situations. Having developed a wide repertoire of problem-solving skills and critical thinking, students will then be able to apply their knowledge to solve complex and non-routine tasks. Some of the general problem-solving strategies will include the Polya’s problem solving strategy and the use of heuristics.   

**Polya’s 4-Step Problem Solving**<br>
George Polya was a mathematician in the 1940s. He devised a systematic process for solving problems that is now referred to by his name, the Polya 4-Step Problem-Solving Process. 

Polya’s 4-step is used to guide our students to systematically approach and solve the problem.

Step 1: **Understand** the problem

*   Read the problem carefully to understand what is required in the problem.
*   Draw or write down the information given in the problem in a simpler form

Step 2: **Plan** what to do/Devise a plan

*   Choose a strategy to use to solve the problem

Step 3: **Do** it/Carry out the plan

*   Carry out your plan to solve the problem.

Step 4: **Check** the solution

*   Check the reasonableness of your solution
*   Seek alternative solutions

The common **Heuristics** to solve problems also include: 

*   Make a systematic listing
*   Guess and check / Make a supposition or assumption
*   Simplify the problem
*   Look for a pattern
*   Work backwards 
**Model drawing** is an important problem-solving strategy that enables students to translate information of the given problem into a pictorial form which aid students’ understanding of the problem. As the students advance in Math learning, the more complex problem sums can be broken down using model drawing. Students learn to visualize different parts of the information to see how the parts are related to one another to form a larger pattern. Many of the more complex model drawings are permutations from the basic part-whole and comparison models from the lower primary. Therefore, it is an essential problem-solving skill that will anchor the students’ problem-solving competency.

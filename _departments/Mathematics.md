#### Teaching and Learning Processes

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach** <br>

In Admiralty Primary, we provide meaningful learning experiences to bring about deep learning where students learn to transfer their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. 

Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in teaching and learning, students learn to make connections and meanings with the more abstract concepts. Students use concrete materials like interlocked cubes, fraction discs and other materials to help them understand the concepts. Students also learn to draw models and see the connection between these models and their related equations.

**Development of metacognition** <br>

In Math lessons, students are encouraged to develop their reasoning and metacognitive skills. Metacognition is the awareness and regulation of one’s thinking. Students are often exposed to non-routine or open-ended problems so that they learn to decide on the problem-solving strategies to be used. Checking for the reasonableness of their answers and thinking through the logic of their solutions are also part of the metacognitive processes. 

**Below are some of the students’ metacognitive responses to the Math tasks.**

**Task:**<br>
**Which are the prime numbers from 1 to 30?**<br>
I determined the prime numbers by removing all the multiples that involved numbers other than 1 and themselves. In total, there were 12 prime numbers in the set of 30 numbers.

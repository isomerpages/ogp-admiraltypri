## Teaching and Learning Processes

#### Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach

In Admiralty Primary, we provide meaningful learning experiences to bring about deep learning where students learn to transfer their knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. 

  
Through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in teaching and learning, students learn to make connections and meanings with the more abstract concepts. Students use concrete materials like interlocked cubes, fraction discs and other materials to help them understand the concepts. Students also learn to draw models and see the connection between these models and their related equations.

#### Development of metacognition

In Math lessons, students are encouraged to develop their reasoning and metacognitive skills. Metacognition is the awareness and regulation of one’s thinking. Students are often exposed to non-routine or open-ended problems so that they learn to decide on the problem-solving strategies to be used. Checking for the reasonableness of their answers and thinking through the logic of their solutions are also part of the metacognitive processes. 

Below are some of the students’ metacognitive responses to the Math tasks.

#### Problem-solving strategies  

Students will face with problems coming from everyday contexts or in future work situations. Having developed a wide repertoire of problem-solving skills and critical thinking, students will then be able to apply their knowledge to solve complex and non-routine tasks. Some of the general problem-solving strategies will include the Polya’s problem solving strategy and the use of heuristics.   

  

**Polya’s 4-Step Problem Solving**

  

George Polya was a mathematician in the 1940s. He devised a systematic process for solving problems that is now referred to by his name, the Polya 4-Step Problem-Solving Process. 

  

Polya’s 4-step is used to guide our students to systematically approach and solve the problem.

  

Step 1: **Understand** the problem

*   Read the problem carefully to understand what is required in the problem.
*   Draw or write down the information given in the problem in a simpler form 

Step 2: **Plan** what to do/Devise a plan

*   Choose a strategy to use to solve the problem

Step 3: **Do** it/Carry out the plan

*   Carry out your plan to solve the problem.

Step 4: **Check** the solution

*   Check the reasonableness of your solution
*   Seek alternative solutions 

The common **Heuristics** to solve problems also include: 

*   Make a systematic listing
*   Guess and check / Make a supposition or assumption
*   Simplify the problem
*   Look for a pattern
*   Work backwards 

**Model drawing** is an important problem-solving strategy that enables students to translate information of the given problem into a pictorial form which aid students’ understanding of the problem. As the students advance in Math learning, the more complex problem sums can be broken down using model drawing. Students learn to visualize different parts of the information to see how the parts are related to one another to form a larger pattern. Many of the more complex model drawings are permutations from the basic part-whole and comparison models from the lower primary. Therefore, it is an essential problem-solving skill that will anchor the students’ problem-solving competency.

To prepare students for life and work in the 21st century

“To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.” – Theodore Roosevelt

To educate a man in morals and not in performance character consequently makes him a liability to society. Thus we believe in the importance of preparing our pupils, not just to be successful pupils, but also to be successful adults, exemplary and useful to society in the future.

We engage pupils in their head, heart and hands through both national and various school-based curricula with explicit instruction and experiential learning. Taglines e.g. ‘Do It Right’ and stories e.g. ‘Sleep When The Wind Blows’ and ‘Hare and Tortoise’ are used and constantly reiterated at various platforms as part of our whole-school approach to character and citizenship education.

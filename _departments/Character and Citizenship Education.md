<h4>CCE: Anchored in Character, Guided by Purpose</h4>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic
development of our Admirals, shaping values, character, well-being, and
citizenship dispositions for positive life outcomes. Our guiding principles
are to be Admiral-centric, intentional, and coherent, providing a strong
foundation for growth, preparing Admirals for a rapidly evolving world
with the relevant knowledge, skills, and values to navigate the realities
of their time.</p>

<p>Besides our school core values and guiding principles, our programmes
are also built on these three CCE Big Ideas of Identity, Relationships
and Choices:</p>
<p><strong>Identity – “Who am I?”</strong>
<br>- Multi-faceted, shaped by social environment and group belonging.
<br>- Involves self-reflection: Who am I? Who do I want to be?
<br>- Positive identity has purpose that benefits self and others.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships – “How do I relate to myself, others and the world?”</strong>
<br>- Identity shaped by relationships and social context.
<br>- Schools nurture belonging, trust, resilience, inclusivity.
<br>- Strong ties build positive culture and sense of community.</p>
<p><strong>Choices – “How do I choose to be and act?”</strong>
<br>- Reflects agency, responsibility, and future aspirations.
<br>- Internal choices: values, morality, goals.
<br>- External choices: actions in family, school, society, world.
<br>- Informed decisions impact both self and others.</p>

<p><strong><em>Be Admirably Kind</em></strong>
<br>Be Admirably Kind Week is a dedicated time for our Admirals to reflect
on and practise the value of kindness in their everyday interactions. Through
thoughtfully designed activities that encourage appreciation, gratitude,
and inclusivity, Admirals are reminded that kindness is a powerful force
that strengthens relationships and nurtures a caring school community.
This focused week serves as a meaningful reminder that being admirably
kind is a value we uphold and a habit we strive to live by.</p>

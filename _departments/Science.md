<h3>Science &amp; Engineering Practices</h3>
<p>This set of practices describe behaviours that scientists engage in as
they investigate phenomena and build theories about the world around them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It provides a framework to help students deepen their scientific thinking
by combining knowledge with practice. Students acquire skills such as questioning,
gathering data, analysing and communicating, all of which are transferable
across other disciplines.</p>

<p><em>Students plan investigations to collect data to&nbsp; identify scientific principles&nbsp; (e.g., measurements, observations, patterns) to support their scientific explanations.</em>

<p><em>Students construct a scientific argument by comparing and evaluating competing new evidence and ethical issues.</em>

<h3>Environmental Education</h3>
<p>To shape studentsâ€™ attitude towards caring for the environment, the school
seeks to raise awareness of environmental issues and develop green habits
in our students. Through rethinking their everyday actions, students learn
that every one can play a part in environmental sustainability. Students
are also encouraged to be an advocate for the environment by encouraging
their peers and family members to adopt green habits.</p>
<p>The school also works in collaboration with external partners such as
National Environmental Agency (NEA), Waterways Watch Society (WWS) and
North West Community Development Council (NWCDC) to garner their expertise
and support the activities run by these external partners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regular reminders and campaigns were conducted to encourage students to
practice green habits in school and at home.</p>
